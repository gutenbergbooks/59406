<h1>KING PENDA’S CAPTAIN</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">OF FEARGUS AND KING PENDA</span></h2>

<p>It chanced in the days when the preaching of
Augustine and his followers had stirred all
England from the Tyne to the Thames and the
English sea that there arose in the Midlands, by
the waters of Trent, a king of the Mercians named
Penda, son of Wybba, who, though he counted
full fifty years when he came to be king, had spirit
like to that of a young man, and he was a great
warrior and faithful unto death to that which he
held true. When he saw the people of the lands
around him casting over the gods of their forefathers
and following the new faith he was wrath,
and the more so with Northumbria, which had
far outstripped the other nations of the Angles
under its noble and mighty king. For Edwin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
had broken the old gods and brought under his
overlordship the countrymen of Penda, and the
North Angles, the Middle Angles, East Angles, and
Southumbrians or men of Lindesey. Penda had
seen all these things but had bided his time,
though the great heart in him beat hard as he
beheld. And when he came to be king he saw
himself beset with foes: on the one hand his
people were hemmed in by the Welsh and West
Saxons, on the other by the North English and
Middle English, East Angles and Lindiswaras or
Lindeseymen, while towering above all was impregnable
Northumbria. When Penda arose the
heathen people, seeing the front of him, rallied,
and he led them forth and conquered: his sword
fell first upon his near neighbours the North
Angles, Middle Angles, East Angles, and Southumbrians,
and he brought them in under him. And,
the heathen people still gathering to his banner,
he tore the lands to the west from the West
Saxons and overthrew king Cadwalla of Wales.
Then the Welsh king, seeing what a mighty man
was Penda, joined hands with him, and together
they brought the kingdom of Wessex to their feet.
So everywhere the Mercians had the victory.
Then, at length, king Edwin lifted his war brand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and gathered together a mighty host and went to
meet the Mercians, but in a great fight Penda
overthrew the Northumbrians, and Edwin himself
was slain. So the power of Northumbria
waned, until its new king, Oswald, roused himself,
and went forth to help the Christian East Anglians
against Penda, and with him went a mighty host.
When Penda heard of his coming, he looked to his
men and sent out ships bearing a messenger to
one Nechtan of the Hundred Battles, a great chief
among the Albanich or Picts, who, though most
of the Pictish tribes had adopted the new religion,
still stood by the old gods of his race. Now
battle was to Nechtan as the breath of his nostrils,
so that, though he cared less for his faith than did
Penda for Odin and Thor and Freya, yet, whenever
they brought him the summons he arose, and
taking with him his son Feargus, and the most
tried of his warriors, as many as the ships would
carry, he sailed south for the land of Mercia.</p>

<p>Great was the joy of Penda at gaining so mighty
a chief to his aid, and they went out together to
meet king Oswald. Then Penda took command
of the one half of that great host and Nechtan
with his son Feargus of the other. And Penda
fought with great might, and king Nechtan likewise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and his son Feargus. And it chanced in the
midst of the fight that Penda saw the Pictish
chief stumble, and ran forward to catch him, and
carried him to his tent. Then the son of Nechtan
was wrath at the wounding of the king his father,
and he led his men so cunningly, as did also the
mighty Penda, that the forces of Oswald were
routed, and Oswald himself was slain. So Penda
was greatly pleased with the hardihood of Nechtan
and of his son, and before they went forth to their
own land he begged the Pictish king to leave the
youth, Feargus, with him to be his man, and he
would, on his side, train him up in all manly
ways. Now Nechtan was loth to part with his
best captain, for, though yet but a boy, such he
deemed his son, Feargus, but at length, for love of
Penda and for that great service he had done him
on the field of battle, he agreed.</p>

<p>“For well I wot,” said he, “that home-keeping
youths have homely wits, and I know there
is not such a warrior as Penda the world
through.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;" id="illus2">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="480" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">So Feargus put his hands between the hands of Penda,
and became his man.</p>
</div>

<p>So Feargus put his hands between the hands of
Penda and became his man, and swore on his
father’s sword to be faithful and obedient, and to
stand by the king in all matters soever. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
after a short sojourn for the healing of his wound,
king Nechtan departed, leaving behind a company
of two hundred Picts, especially chosen for
their size and strength and hardihood, to serve
his son.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">OF FEARGUS AND TORFRIDA</span></h2>

<p>So Feargus stayed behind with king Penda, and
soon his name became known through all the
land. Though he was yet ungrown, men looked
upon him as a man, for so was he limbed; and
such was he for hardihood and cunning with all
weapons that he soon excelled all the captains
of the king. In stature he towered above his
fellows, and his strength was like that of two men.
He sought no fight nor feared any, yet his enemies
were adread of him; but not less loved was he of
his friends, and his manners were so mild, withal,
that the poorest might speak with him familiarly.
Besides Feargus, were other captains of Penda,
chief among whom were his sons Peada and
Wulfere; and Osbert, son to the king of the North
English,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with his brothers Godwine, Thorkill, and
Tosti and his cousin Edgar. These were rich and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
great, and there were also many kings and nobles
gathered about the city of Tamworth, the chief
town of Mercia. Of these was one Sigmund, king
of the Lindiswaras, who, with his daughter Torfrida,
was much about the hall of Penda. So
Feargus dwelt among the Mercians and they fought
many battles, and great was their gain, and the
cause of the Christians waned before them. But
gradually the spirit of the new faith fell upon its
enemies and even Sigmund, the chief friend of
Penda, drifted slowly over, and with him went
his daughter Torfrida. So that when Penda
made war on the Christian king of the East
Anglians, Sigmund no longer followed him and he
was wrath. Now we have seen that Torfrida had
been much about the hall of Penda, for the old
warrior loved the little maiden, and felt his
hearth brighter for her presence; but when Sigmund
withheld from Penda in his war on king
Anna of East Anglia, Torfrida was denied king
Penda’s halls and great sorrow fell upon Feargus.
For the youth now learned that he loved the
damsel, now when he dare no longer make it
known to Penda or to herself; for the king had
said that he must not enter Sigmund’s land; so
Feargus went forth to the fight heavy-hearted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
And when they wended homeward after harrying
and burning the lands of the Christians he sighed
for Torfrida; and so one night he mounted his
horse in secret and, taking a clarsach, or small
harp, and a minstrel’s cloak, rode away eastward,
and still rode through the next day until he won
Sigmund’s land. Being dressed as a minstrel no
one heeded him, for minstrels were held in great
honour amongst the English as amongst the
Albanich, and as he rode he made a little song.
He entered the town of Lindum, which was set on
a high hill, and sought out the king’s halls, and
there in the garden beheld Torfrida walking to
and fro with head downcast and greeting,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
ever and anon wringing her small hands. She
was as fair as an April morning and not less fresh
and fragrant; like a golden river her hair fell
over her white throat and shoulders to her waist;
deep blue were her eyes and her forehead low and
straight and square; pink cheeks she had, and
parted lips—fit guardians of her precious breath,
if breathe indeed like common folk she did.
“Now,” thought Feargus, “if she weeps for me I
am glad of my coming; but gin she greets for
other cause, and this new faith hath hardened her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
against her old friends, then will the head of
Feargus hang this night over the lintel of king
Sigmund, and Penda will know that Feargus hath
broken his word which as a youth he swore on
his father’s sword, and his name will go down
without honour among the Albanich, and his
enemy Osbert will rejoice.” Then Feargus walked
out towards the garden and, drawing his harp,
sang the simple song which he had made in
riding through the woods that morning. Done
with great freedom from the old English into the
new it ran thus:—</p>

<p>Torfrida paused in her walk when the first notes
fell upon her ear. She heard the song right
through and smiled sadly and wept a little, and
then turned swiftly and ran through the green
bushes and threw her arms round the tall minstrel
with a little cry of joy. And when she had found
her tongue she said—</p>

<p>“Feargus, O Feargus! what dost thou here?
If the men of Sigmund do but see thee, then
neither I nor any other can save thee.”</p>

<p>“Then thou art of a mind, sweet Torfrida, to
save the enemy of Sigmund and the conqueror
of the Christians.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast wronged me if ever thou hast
thought that I could betray thee; but what brings
thee here?” she added, with a woman’s disingenuousness.</p>

<p>“Thyself, Torfrida.”</p>

<p>“Myself!”</p>

<p>“Nay now, thou well knowest ’tis thyself;
never since the day thy father took thee away has
there been any joy in the world for Feargus, nor
will be till thou art back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Back, ah! that I will never be, noble Feargus,
slayer of Christians though thou art—but get
thee hence, for hast thou not broken Penda’s
bidding by coming into this land?”</p>

<p>“That have I, and that must I again, if I may
not see thee without, for thou, Torfrida, hast the
heart of Feargus.”</p>

<p>“And thou that of Torfrida.”</p>

<p>Long time they stood with hands locked, and
much they spake, till the maidens of Torfrida
came out to seek their mistress. Then said Torfrida,
“Never again must thou come, O Feargus,
for an the men of Penda or of my father caught
thee, even though death were not dealt to thee,
thou wouldest be for ever disgraced.”</p>

<p>“I cannot live without seeing thee, sweet Torfrida,
and must come.”</p>

<p>“Nay, rather will I ride forth to meet thee on
Penda’s land than that thou shouldst break
thine oath to the king.”</p>

<p>“Brave indeed thou art, but I am loth to break
my faith with the old man, though sorry that
thou shouldst run into danger.”</p>

<p>“Nay, little danger will it be to me in my
father’s land, and in Penda’s thy presence will
shield me from all questions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>And so they left it, and many times Torfrida
rode out to meet her lover on the verge of king
Penda’s land.</p>

<p>And Penda waxed more and more bitter against
the Christians, while Feargus’s ardour grew less
and less as he learnt something of their faith from
Torfrida, for hard she beset him. At length it
fell one evening that king Sigmund asked for his
daughter, and her maidens could not find her;
high and low they looked, but in vain, till at
nightfall she returned, and Sigmund asked whither
she had been, and Torfrida blushed and at
length told the king her father, and he was much
angered.</p>

<p>“So thou hast been holding tryst with thy
father’s foe, and thou a Christian!”</p>

<p>Then Torfrida wept and asked forgiveness.</p>

<p>“Nay, I cannot forgive thee till thou hast
broken this bond with young Feargus. The
Christian may not wed with the worshipper of
false gods. I little thought that child of mine
could wish to wed with one who had lifted his
hand against me.”</p>

<p>And then Sigmund sent for the priest who dwelt
with them, and he was wrath and forbade her
trysting with Feargus, and they kept her a prisoner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in her room until such times, said her father, as she
promised to abandon her lover.</p>

<p>And at the end of a month they came to her
for an answer, and she said: “Never will I break
my troth with Feargus, or wed other, Christian or
heathen, for that I love him; and where love is,
God will not and man may not come between; if
he is infidel, will he not surely need a Christian to
wife the more?”</p>

<p>And there was anger between Sigmund and
Torfrida, for he was wishful that she should
strengthen his hands by wedding a Christian king.
So Torfrida sent her brother Edwy secretly to
meet Feargus at their tryst, to bid him beware,
and Feargus turned homewards heavy-hearted.</p>

<p>Now it happened that at this time Penda sent
Feargus as a messenger to Northumbria, and
there he fell in with one of the Christian priests of
his own race, who took a liking to the young Pict,
and Feargus, being by no means as bitter against
the Christian as was his master Penda, listened
to all he had to say, and received it kindly. So
that before leaving he told the priest if it had not
been for his duty to the old king and to his father,
he would have almost become a Christian, whereupon
the priest tried to show him that being of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
this mind his duty to his Maker was before that
to his king and father.</p>

<p>“Such is not the law of my father’s people,”
said Feargus, “for if I betray my trust to my
master, how will I be fit to keep that to the God
of the Christians. If thou canst overcome the
old king with thy reasoning I will be glad, but if
thou canst not, then must I yet stand by him to
the end, and his enemies will still be mine.”</p>

<p>Feargus went his way southward till he won
home again, but from that day much of the merry
youthfulness of him died, and he walked with
knotted brow and doubting heart and no longer
sang blithely the war songs of the Albanich, but
chose the plaintive and sorrowful ones instead,
that suited best his spirit. And he could see
dimly that in the days to come the new faith
would rise triumphant over all lets and hindrances
soever, for in it was truth so great and so plain
withal that men had but to hearken to be overcome,
and in the future he saw trouble for Penda
and trouble for himself.</p>

<p>And when he reached home he found that
Penda was making ready to march upon king
Sigmund and had sworn to burn his city and harry
his land, and Feargus was much troubled; for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
knew that he must lift his hand against the kin of
Torfrida—and what might not happen to her in
the press and thick of the fight, when men spared
neither old nor young; and how would her people
let her marry with him who entered their land
as a destroyer? And one day, as he was riding
abroad, a man dressed as a beggar came up and
drew close to him and whispered as he passed, and
Feargus started, and, gathering his reins from the
beast’s neck, rode on all that night and, at the
morning, came to a wood. By this he lingered,
until at noon he heard the sound of hoofs and
saw Torfrida with two maidens accompanying
her on palfreys; and he took her in his arms and
kissed her, and saw that she was pale and careworn.</p>

<p>“I have come, O Feargus, to ask thee to spare
my father and my kin for love of me; for know I
well and all the world that if king Penda marches
against us, my father will be overthrown; for his
might is not like that of Penda, nor his captains
like Penda’s captains.”</p>

<p>Then the water burst forth his eyes as he
answered, “I would do much to serve king Penda,
more would I do to serve thee; yet to Penda I
plighted myself before I plighted myself to thee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and on my father’s sword I swore, so I cannot
break my troth, sweet Torfrida, though my heart
be torn in twain with grief for thee. Let me tell
thee, also, Torfrida, that since I saw thee I have
been persuaded that thy new faith is true, and
that a greater power than of Penda’s will be
needed to tear it from men’s minds. Yet I am
his man; he is old and I would not desert him at
this hour, even though I could without dishonour;
for the old man, grim though he be at times, is
steadfast in friendship as he is terrible in battle,
and from a youth he hath cared for me and
taught me as his son and not less steadfast shall
he find me.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast said thou lovest me above all
things else, yet wilt thou destroy me and my kin;
thou art a Christian, yet wilt thou destroy the
Christians.”</p>

<p>“A hard saying is that thou hast said: weep
not so, my golden-haired one—thy sickness hath
turned thy mind in this matter—in a different
mood thou spokest when last we met in this
place.”</p>

<p>“Call me no longer thy golden-haired one, and
get thee hence, thou killer of Christians; with the
aid of thee and thine Sigmund might turn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
battle against Penda, but thou hast denied it; get
thee hence; never more shalt thou gaze upon
Torfrida.”</p>

<p>“Say not so—thou art beside thyself, and thy
father hath prevailed upon thee to say these
things—thou wilt not away, Torfrida, till I take
my farewell of thee!”</p>

<p>But Torfrida pulled her rein and smote her
horse and rode on, and Feargus neither moved
nor spoke, but white like a dead man stood and
gazed after her.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BATTLE BY TRENT WATER</span></h2>

<p>But a few days later king Penda’s host was ready
and they marched eastwards from the town of
Lichfield, where Penda was then staying, intending
to cross the Trent water below Nottingham,
which stood beside the forest of Sherwood. And
soon king Sigmund knew of Penda’s coming and
started out to meet him, with all his strength, and
thinking to fall upon him before he reached Trent,
marched west from Lindum city, then, crossing
the river, turned southwards through the forest.
But Penda learnt of his coming, and in the night
time hastening on with swiftness, took up a strong
position below the high banks which skirt the
river to the east a little below Nottingham.
There he hid his men among the woods on the
banks above, and mid the broom on the plain
below, leaving the lowlands to the westward free
to the Lindeseymen. And Feargus was in great
sorrow at finding himself of the party. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
through the day there was no stir or sound
amongst all that great host. At length towards
evening they beheld the banners of their foes.
Then the Mercians sprung to life, and they filled
all the narrow plain that lay between the cliffs
and the river with foot, and the left wing with
the horse under Osbert marched south hoping to
reach the rear, ready to ford the stream and
attack the Lindeseymen from the west and so
drive them in upon the archers and footmen of
Feargus and Wulfere, who, hidden by the wood
and brambles, lined all the cliffs on the east side
of Trent. In the narrow plain below, opposite
the ford, stood Penda, commanding the centre
and waiting without movement the coming of
Sigmund. Soon the plain to the north and west
was filled with a great array of foot and horsemen,
and when Feargus beheld them from his post
on the cliff his heart fluttered and he forgot his
troubles a while, for he was in very soul a warrior
and the sight of that armed host was like strong
wine to him. Sigmund had meanwhile sent a
large party of bowmen across the river to hold the
cliffs. Feargus thereupon called to Wulfere to
command the bowmen, while he gathered his foot
and went out to meet the foe, seeing that the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
who must decide this battle were in his hand.
The enemy below being now within bowshot, the
bowmen of Wulfere sent a shower of arrows forth
such as astonished those men of Lindesey; for
till now they had seen no sign of life in the wood
or anywhere but in front of them, where fluttered
the banner of Penda. And they marched on,
their ranks falling in whole lines before the terrible
arrows, which flew from the very cliffs which
Sigmund had sent the flower of his army to win,
thinking that the Mercians had only just arrived.
Still the white-haired Penda sat motionless upon
his beast and took no note of the weak reply that
was made to them by the archers Sigmund had
kept with him. Then suddenly a great cry arose
in the rear of Sigmund’s army, as the horsemen of
Osbert, who had worked round to their flank from
the south, fell upon them, followed by many companies
of foot. Sigmund looked anxiously to
where his bow and footmen should be, on the
cliff, but at that moment the Picts under Feargus,
with Welsh from Wales, and Welsh also who still
dwelt in Mercia, and with the famous British
bowmen of Arden and the Warwickshire woodlands
under king Penda, and many English,
burst out from the woods; and they drove the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Lindeseymen before them like sheep, so fiercely
and suddenly they leapt forth. Then was the
heather blood bedewed, and the golden broom
turned to red, and ever the Picts and Welsh
pushed on and the men of Sigmund held back, till
at last they were driven over the cliffs, and
Feargus sent the Welsh after them down the bank,
they being lightest of foot. And they beat them
down towards the plain below where was king
Sigmund. And the arrows of the Mercians
darkened the very lift, and Penda himself had
now moved on against the king, and when he
beheld him Sigmund was adread, and his warriors
stood still; for all men went in fear of Penda.
Then Sigmund saw his men driven down from the
cliffs to the north-east before the dread cry
“Albanich! Albanich!” and he knew that there
were Feargus and his Picts. And still he cried,
“On, on!” but little room was there left for sword
play on that narrow strath by the great river,
for the press of the men driven in by Feargus on
the east and by Osbert on the west became so
great that friend struck friend unwittingly, and
no man had room to ply his arms. King Sigmund
down in the glen now saw that all was lost, and
he wound his horn that those who could might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
escape, and himself, with many good footmen,
held the ford against the centre of the Mercian
host led by Penda. Slowly but grimly Sigmund
gave back, step by step, until many of his bowmen
had gained the west side of Trent water, and
then all that remained plunged into the river
and fled towards the forest with the king. And
shouts of “Kill, kill!” arose from the Mercians
and, like dogs let loose, they broke their ranks and
fell upon the fugitives.</p>

<p>Then Feargus wound his horn and strove to
stay the slaughter, but little sense had the most
of them left; they were drunk with blood, and
only his own men gathered around him. And
the rush of the Lindeseymen was ever towards
Lindum, their city; some fled through the forest
there to ford the stream, and some turned east
and made their way into the fens, and the Mercians
followed those that fled through the forest and
those that fled up the east bank of Trent. Feargus’s
thoughts were for Torfrida and to save Sigmund,
if it might be. Seeing that Penda had kept
together a great body of men about him and was
safe from surprise, Feargus horsed as many of his
followers as he could find beasts for, and the rest
held each a stirrup and ran with them afoot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
The chase lasted till midnight when they came
within sight of Sigmund’s city of Lincoln or
Lindum, which stood high on a great hill; but
already the Mercians were at its gates; some had
scaled the walls and some were in fight with the
fugitives as they came up. Riding hard across
the plain below, Feargus saw fire burst from one of
the ports; a great shout followed, and now all the
sky was filled with flames and smoke and myriads
of sparks; for a moment the men slackened their
speed, awe-stricken, at the savage sight. Feargus
saw that the town had fallen, and, leaving his
men behind, dashed on like a madman. When
he neared the gate the fire lighted up the bloody
hands and faces of the besiegers, flushed with
drink and victory, and he shuddered as he beheld
them—little mercy would king or lady get from
these men, and, spurring his horse, he burst through
the press, and when they heard his cry, “Albanich!
Albanich!” they made way, though with curses
at being turned from their prey. Through the
burning town he rode; one or two tried to stay
him, but he dashed them fiercely aground, and at
last drew up by the hall of Sigmund. Here the
press was thicker, and he saw the door was down
and the drunken rout were in; and coarse jests and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
oaths and shrieks filled the air. Then Feargus
sprang from his beast and burst in, crying, “Back,
back!” but the soldiers heeded him not, and one
even turned and struck him. Now a giant was
Feargus, his red head stood out a full span above
the dark-haired Britons of Arden forest and the
pale-haired English of the towns, and he laid hold
of him who struck, by the waist, and lightly
tossed him out through the open door, and then,
not wishing to slay any, seized an oaken staff
and dealt blows right and left; each one he
struck was quickly sobered and asked for no
more. At length he gained the hall. There he
found the Mercians gathered also, but he burst
through them to the king’s chamber where he
beheld Sigmund’s youngest son, Edwy, with half-a-dozen
stalwart thanes. At his feet lay his two
brothers, dead; while behind, crouching to the
floor, her hands clasped in prayer and her knees
wet with the blood of the slain, was Torfrida.
Hard bestead were those brave Lindeseymen, and
wounded and sore with fighting; before them
were many Mercian thanes, while others tried to
force a way in at the door. These Feargus roughly
seized and thrust to right and left until he
won in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stay, Mercians,” he shouted to the combatants,
but they heeded him not, and so, pushing
one away, he stepped to the side of Edwy and
drew his sword, shouting, “I am your captain:
stand back, Mercians!”</p>

<p>Then, seeing who it was that bid them, they
forbore.</p>

<p>“Enough killing have ye done this day,” said
he. Then, speaking to Edwy, he pledged his
safety; so Edwy submitted, he and the thanes,
as his prisoners. Feargus turned to Torfrida,
but she had fainted; so he lifted her and carried
her out into the air, for the building was all
aflame, and they followed. At the gate Feargus
found Duncan, his captain and many of his men
seeking him, and he sent round and gathered the
rest, with many English and Welsh who loved
him, and they placed the prisoners in their midst
and rode towards Penda’s land. As they went
they found that the more part of the city had
been burnt by the Mercians; and Feargus was
heavy-hearted for Torfrida’s kin, and his conscience
pricked him for the slaying of so many
Christians. And no man knew whence king
Sigmund had departed.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that Penda had been told of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the love of Feargus for Torfrida, by Osbert, his
enemy; and, though the king loved Feargus
much, he felt anger against him, and Osbert had
even advised him secretly to seize the Pict. So
when Penda learnt from the thanes who had
slain her two brethren, of the saving of Torfrida
and Edwy by Feargus, he sent for the prisoners,
and ordered Torfrida to be imprisoned and the
boy Edwy and his thanes to be slain. When
Feargus heard of this he hied him to Penda and
stood up, and said he—</p>

<p>“O king Penda, sore have we wrought
against Sigmund and his kin, and many men of
his have we slain, little boots it to slay this boy or
the faithful thanes who fought for him, in cold
blood. Right well they wrought and soldierly
against thy thanes, but an unsoldierly death
wouldst thou deal to them; oh, never will the
light of day seem fair to thy captain Feargus if
the blood of these warriors stains the sword of
his king. Doth the conqueror of Edwin, and
Oswald, and Sigeberht, and Ceanwealh, and Sigmund
need the blood of a boy who hath only once
wielded war brand?”</p>

<p>“I have spoken,” said the king; “thou art
over bold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Then said Feargus again, “Call me not so,
king Penda; never canst thou mean that this
boy must die and no greater thing against him
than that he was ready to stand up fighting
to the last, as though he had been in full manhood.”</p>

<p>“That surely I mean.”</p>

<p>“Then, O king, for the fellowship that is
between us give not thy hand to this work, for
not only will it hurt me—for the Albanich war
not on children—but thee, also, will it hurt before
the eyes of all the world.”</p>

<p>“I have said, and thou and all here have but
to obey, and there are few, as thou wottest, who
would have dared, as thou hast, to look askance
at what I do; but ware thee lest thou carriest
this thing too far, and keep well thy tongue.
These and all the enemies of Odin shall

<p>“Thou hast gained a victory over Sigmund
and great will thy praise be, and I, though no kin
of thine, in payment of thy teaching for years
past, have done something to get thee that
victory and many more besides like to it, yet
thou wilt not grant me so little a boon as this
boy’s life and this maiden’s liberty, even though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
as thou wottest they are Albanich by the
mother’s side, if not of my tribe.”</p>

thee: hence, I say!”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FLIGHT</span></h2>

<p>Feargus went forth from Penda’s hall in an
angry mood and sought out Edwy as he was
being taken to the tower wherein they were to
cast him and spoke in his ear. The killing was
fixed for the morrow. At midnight Feargus
arose, and, taking his sword, entered the king’s
stable and led therefrom seven beasts of best
blood with all their trappings, riding them into
the forest hard by the town. He then went to
the building wherein lay Edwy with his thanes;
he whistled thrice, till one appeared at the window
high up in the tower. Then Feargus drew forth
a light cord and threw it up that they caught it,
and therewith drew up a stouter one. Fastening
this above, they slid down it to the ground, until
the whole seven of them stood beside him, the
last to descend being the boy Edwy.</p>

<p>“Thou art great of heart for thy years, brother,
and gentle withal,” said Feargus; “thy stoutness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
will all be needed this night; but for thy
sister Torfrida have no fear, for I swear to thee
that nought ill shall befall her while I have life;
and if I die, my kin and thine shall avenge her;
so be ye comforted. She should have ridden
with thee this night, but she is prisoned in the
very halls of the king where none may enter.”
Then, having reached the wood, they mounted
their beasts and Feargus kissed the boy, and
“May the God of the Christians speed ye,” said
he, and they departed.</p>

<p>Then Feargus returned to his lodging and
threw himself down; but he was uneasy for
Torfrida’s safety so that he slept little, and in the
morning he arose betimes and donned his arms
and went forth. He had gone but a little way
before he heard a great noise and saw many
people running hither and thither, so he asked
one, Oscar, the king’s seneschal, what might be
amiss.</p>

<p>“Have you not heard, noble Feargus, that the
youth Edwy Sigmundsson with all his thanes
have broken their prison, and have entered the
king’s stable and taken therefrom seven fleet
horses and are away. And the king is so wrath
that all men are adread of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Seek no more, good Oscar, for here at your
hand is the thief and the prison-breaker.”</p>

<p>“What mean you?”</p>

<p>“That I, Feargus, let the birds free and broke
the king’s stable.”</p>

<p>“If thou wilt be advised thou wilt tell none
other that news.”</p>

<p>“Thanks to thee; but the king hath an evil
counsellor who will see my hand in this and will
be ready to do my cause an injury therewith, so
I will hie me straight to Penda and be beforehand
with him.”</p>

<p>“Then may the gods defend thee, for never
saw I the king more wrath.”</p>

<p>So Feargus turned him towards the hall where
the king sat; there he found Penda, white with
rage, fiercely pacing the floor. At his side was
Osbert, who, as he turned and saw Feargus,
started violently, for his name had been at that
moment on his lips.</p>

<p>“Call in thy messengers, king Penda,” said
Feargus, “for vainly they seek Edwy Sigmundsson;
he is away, and he who set him free and
broke thy stable for beasts to carry him and his
thanes stands before thee.”</p>

<p>Then the king swore a great oath, and snatching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
up a heavy spear which stood beside him,
hurled it at the speaker; but Feargus moved
quickly aside and the weapon flew past him and,
striking the wall, buried itself therein. Feargus
stood still again, calmly eyeing the king. Not
so, however, his captain Duncan, who was ever
at his back, eagle-eyed but jovial of countenance;
as the king threw, his sword leapt over his shoulder
whereupon he carried it, and the king being without
arms drew back a pace.</p>

<p>“Put up thy sword, good Duncan,” said
Feargus, “and pray the king to pardon thee, for
thou wert ever hasty; but no thought of unfaithfulness
to the king hadst thou, that will I be
sworn.”</p>

<p>“Now I pray thee, king Penda, that though
thou mayest not pardon me, thou wilt pardon my
faithful and much-loved Duncan, in whom thy
friend my father had great pride; for not among
all thy men canst thou find his equal.”</p>

<p>Now the king ever loved boldness, and in
secret smiled at Duncan, though fiercely he
spake.</p>

<p>“Well thou sayest, else death should have
both him and thee, for all that I am not unmindful
of thy services: it shall be long ere thou shalt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
again stand in this hall. Take thou,” he said,
turning to the seneschal Oscar, “the chief Feargus,
and put him in the great tower, and with water
and bread feed him, and there let him remain.”</p>

<p>So they took Feargus, who went readily, and
they treated him fair, he being much beloved by
them, and left him his sword, for no need had
they, said Oscar, to put a slight upon him who
stood so well in the sight of all men. But great
was the wrath of the Picts when they saw their
chief led away captive; for they cared not for
Penda, or whether he were Christian or whether
heathen, but only for their leader, and him they
followed through the town to his prison, with
Duncan at their head; and they were mighty and
tall men and thick of limb, and ever ready in a
desperate fight. Then Feargus minded them of
the wishes of Nechtan their king, telling them to
obey Penda and stay quiet. So they obeyed, but
of their own will divided themselves into two
bodies, the one half of them lying down outside
the prison of Feargus, and the other half beneath
the windows of Torfrida. So they kept Feargus
in knowledge of all that happened, and he was
greatly comforted to know they lay and watched
for Torfrida. And daily they played outside his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
prison on the clarsach and on the pipes the noble
songs of the Albanich.</p>

<p>When Penda heard that they lay day and night
outside the prison of their chief and of Torfrida,
he was not unpleased, for he loved ever the faithful
and the bold, and was secretly ashamed that
he had been led into cruelty, such as had never
stained his name, by Osbert’s evil influence. So
at length, after a month had passed, he minded
him of their services and sent for Duncan, who
pleaded hard for Torfrida that she might be set
free; for such was the wish of Feargus. The
king’s heart smote him for Torfrida, but Osbert
and his brethren and Edgar his cousin told him
that Feargus loved Torfrida and was himself
being converted to the faith of the Christians and
would yet be on the side of Sigmund and the
Northumbrians. And though Penda refused to
believe that Feargus could be unfaithful to him,
yet he was swayed somewhat by their counsel oft
repeated. So Feargus still chafed in his prison
and was much troubled about many matters.
There was little hope that he might ever again see
Torfrida, and he had much doubt in his mind, for
that the king was so deadly an enemy to the
Christians, of whom he himself was one; yet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
idea of leaving Penda he could not brook. Two
months passed and they brought him word
that Torfrida lay sick, and he ground his teeth
and beat his breast in despair; then Duncan,
with Alastair, his captains, wished him to let them
break his prison and release Torfrida and depart
with her to Alban.</p>

<p>“What would then happen to all ye who
stayed behind,” said he, “nothing less than
death, and how would Nechtan think of him who
had broken oath to Penda and left his men to
die? Nay, good Duncan, it cannot be. Never
will I break troth with thee or with the king.”</p>

<p>Then Duncan went once more to Penda and
said—</p>

<p>“Now, king, we come from our chief, the noble
Feargus, than whom thou hast no more faithful
soldier, to pray thee to set free the lady Torfrida,
his true love, who now lieth sick; for she hath
been bred in the halls of kings and not in dungeons,
and in the darkness fadeth. Ill hast thou requited
our chief for all he hath wrought for thee,
and us his clansmen, who have wielded war
brands for thee. Thy manner of treating thy
warriors is little like to that of the noble chiefs of
our land, king Brude and king Nechtan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Half angry at Duncan and half merry at his
boldness, Penda said, “Thy master hath in thee
a saucy servant; in sooth thou art fitter to deal
blows than to deliver messages.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to Osbert and Edgar and
together they spoke, and the king was for freeing
Torfrida, but Osbert counselled the king, and he
said, “Go back to the chief and tell him that
Torfrida shall go free to her father’s land with
many to keep her in safety, but only if he swears
to hold no tryst with her, nor seek, nor see, nor
speak with her more for ever.”</p>

<p>Then the merry face of Duncan darkened and
his eyes flashed angrily. “Now woe am I to
take back so sad a message, and woe shall it be to
him who comes between where true love is.”</p>

<p>“Out, impudent dog, or such freedom as I
offer her shall be denied.”</p>

<p>So Duncan, full of anger, betook himself back
to the tower of Feargus and told him the message.
Then the strong man broke down, and he saw
in this not the hand of Penda only, but of his
enemies.</p>

<p>The days passed and still they came with long
faces stammering out that she was worse, and
nightly in his thoughts he beheld the sweet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
tender one in the dark cell, where the golden hair
shone in vain for none might see and admire.
Many days he endured till at last they brought
him word that she lay dying, and his heart stood
still. Then in his grief he sent for Duncan and
told him, “Go thou and seek king Penda, for I
cannot live thus longer; tell him that Feargus
will promise anything, do anything, if he will but
release the lady Torfrida. And I swear to thee,
my captain, that an she dies, then will I strike
the proud king dead (though I know he liketh me
well), and Osbert and Edgar my enemies atop of
him, and over all that death pile shall I lie sword
stricken in the hall of Penda.”</p>

<p>So Duncan went again to Penda, taking with
him Alastair his cousin, the others waiting about
outside, and they two agreed that if the king
refused, then they would fall upon him and kill
him while the others should release Torfrida,
seize the king’s sons, Peada and Wulfere, and
getting them all aboard ship, sail to their own
land, they knowing well that nothing would
happen to Feargus while the king’s sons were in
their hands. Then Duncan told Penda that
Torfrida lay a-dying and that his master was nigh
beside himself. This time the king was alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
save for his sons, who were good men both, and
the king said—</p>

<p>“So my little Torfrida dwineth—so shall all
the enemies of the gods; yet I am sorry that it
should have come to thee, child. Thou wert ever
a favourite with me, Torfrida! Penda was not
wont to war with children. Set her free, good
Duncan, set her free, and see to it that she
lacketh nothing; and thou sayest my brave
Feargus is sad—young fool—let him walk free
too.”</p>

<p>“That will I gladly.”</p>

<p>“Nay, not so fast, thou saucy dog—he is
strong, none stronger, a day or two will not hurt
him. Set her free at once, if we free them together
they will be for leave taking—no, let him stay
where he now is till such time as I tell thee; but
say to him that he may be of good heart, for he
shall be speedily freed.”</p>

<p>“That were a mockery, king, for of good heart
will he never be since thou hast forbidden him
the lady Torfrida.”</p>

<p>And so Torfrida was set free, but she lay for
many days ere she could gain strength to walk.
And Osbert went to the king, knowing that Torfrida
was to be released, and offered to escort the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
lady; for so had he plotted, thinking thus to get
her into his own hands.</p>

<p>And Penda said that, as she was a king’s
daughter, he could do no less than send a king’s
son with her, for escort, and fifty men, and so it
was settled.</p>

<p>When Feargus heard this he sent again to
Penda, seeing Osbert’s hand, and Duncan boldly
told the king that Osbert wanted the lady
Torfrida, and that he was the enemy of Feargus,
and they would not trust her with him.</p>

<p>“Darest thou to speak thus against a king’s
son, and the wealthiest thane of my court, and
make these charges.”</p>

<p>“The Albanich care not for kings or thanes
except their own, and them only obey; as to us,
we swore to king Nechtan to do to the utmost for
his son, and I tell thee, king Penda, that we will
go with the lady too or else thou shalt shoot us
all down.”</p>

<p>“Surely thou advancest in boldness; the sooner
thy chief cometh to lead thee the better, for, were
I thy master, I would lead thee with a halter, and
by the gods, wert thou the servant of any other
man, thou shouldst now be dangling from the
town wall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“King, thou hast imprisoned the noble Feargus,
who loved thee and who hath fought for thee as
none other hath, and fearful oath hast thou
drawn from him; if thou now givest his lady
into the hands of the villain Osbert, and destroyest
his captain, his cup will be full.”</p>

<p>“Thou mayest take thy men with Torfrida,
and thyself—but hark ye, never again enter thou
this hall; for surely nothing hath saved thee but
the fact that thy chief loveth thee.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PARTING OF FEARGUS AND TORFRIDA</span></h2>

<p>Then Duncan went swiftly to tell Feargus, and
he was glad beyond measure that his men were
to accompany Torfrida.</p>

<p>“Now I need not tell ye, Duncan, to arm ye all
with your best and take the fleetest horses, and
if Osbert hath laid any trap, seize ye him instantly
and, whoever else may escape, let not him. But
if he hath with him fifty men, like yourself, ye
need fear nothing, for he knoweth well his men
who serve for money are no match for thine who
serve for love. But all of this thou wottest of thyself:
I have little need to tell thee.” So Duncan
went forth on the day set for the journey and
gathered his men, and Osbert brought his friends
also.</p>

<p>Then Torfrida rode out on a horse litter, for
she was weak still, and pale; and only two
maidens rode with her. Seeing Duncan, she
beckoned to him to ride beside her; then speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in Gaelic, which she was well able to do, her
mother having been of the Pictish race, she said,
“Duncan, my friend, leave me not to this man,
nor let him ride beside or near me, for I loathe
him. To him it is we owe the overthrowing of
thy chief; do not trust him with thy safety, nor
that of thy men; surely great number of warriors
he bringeth.”</p>

<p>And Osbert was for setting out on the moment,
but Duncan stayed him while he counted his
men, then, turning to Osbert, he said—</p>

<p>“The number of my men is but fifty, but thou
hast with thee not less than fifty and twenty
gentlemen; a halt we will call till my cousin,
Alastair, hath fetched hither twenty men of ours.”</p>

<p>Then said Osbert, “I come not here to parley
with thee. I speak with thanes and princes, and
all such as thou have but to obey: fall in, therefore,
behind my men.”</p>

<p>At this Alastair glowered and laid his hand upon
his sword, but Duncan, who was of an easier
temper, answered—</p>

<p>“Nay, we are all daoine-uasil<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and of better
blood than thine. Thou knowest well, prince,
that such parleying as this will avail us nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
If thou wishest seventy men, seventy let it be,
since thy will is higher than that of Penda, who
said we might take each of us fifty; but an thou
takest seventy or any other number, then will I
do likewise; but I must first report me to the
king, lest my chief or myself get the blame for
the breaking of his orders.”</p>

<p>Then Osbert bit his lip and swore to be revenged
on the Pict. So they took each fifty men, and
Duncan ordered his company to arrange themselves
round the person of Torfrida, he himself
riding on one side of her with drawn sword and
Alastair on the other, so they had Osbert and his
men in front; but Osbert, seeing this, was angry
and asked wherefore the Picts had arranged
themselves to bring up the rear.</p>

<p>“Nay, prince, thou art the king’s son, methought
it fit and proper that thou shouldst ride
in front, while I, who am but a captain and a
chief’s son, should ride in the rear with the
prisoner, leastwise this is after the manner of the
Albanich, and king Penda hath no bond from
us that we are to live after the customs of the
Mercians, but rather our own way. Such is my
wish to please thee, however, that if ye like to
order my men otherwise ye may do so—thou wilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
find them wondrous meek of manner and easy of
persuasion.”</p>

<p>Osbert knew this for irony, and answered, “So
thou sayest, but, as I have no wish to pick a
quarrel with the like of thee, I will allow this
point; but I must tell thee, that it is proper the
lady should ride with me, who am the chief of
the party, and among my thanes, they being of
her rank. Otherwise king Sigmund will say we
have not shown respect to his daughter, and
Penda hath said at all times that the lady Torfrida
was to be treated gently and above the
common, for he regardeth her greatly.”</p>

<p>“As thou wishest, sir prince, but thou mayest
have the ordering of this thing, for my men look
upon the maiden as the lady of our chief, Feargus,
and therefore their mistress, and the Picts, as ye
call them, are ill to give up what is their own.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;" id="illus3">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="480" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Feargus thrust his body through the opening, and held Torfrida in his arms
and kissed her, and she him.</p>
</div>

<p>Finding all argument vain, Osbert said no
more. So they set forth, and the Albanich,
with Torfrida in their midst, turned along the
road which led to the prison of Feargus, at which
Osbert chafed. And Duncan, knowing that it
would fetch Feargus to the window, ordered his
men to sound their pipes, and so it happened as
Duncan had foreseen, for Feargus hearing them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
came to watch them, pale and grief stricken, and
beheld Torfrida as she rode between his captains,
and she him. Then Duncan, though he knew
that Penda had denied the parting, ordered his
men to halt, but Osbert was for going forward.</p>

<p>“On my head then be it,” said Duncan, taking
Torfrida’s horse by the bridle and leading it
below his master’s window. Then Feargus fell
to greeting, and cried, “My faithful Duncan, I
wot well that of thyself thou hast done this
thing.”</p>

<p>And Duncan made his men mount on to each
others’ backs, and the topmost placed their shields
together, and he stood upright in the saddle,
Alastair doing likewise, and between them they
lifted Torfrida from where she lay sick in the
litter on to the shields, till she stood as high as
the window of Feargus; then the men, and all
they that stood about, cheered, but Osbert chafed
and wanted on. Then Feargus seized the great
bars that fenced the window, which only perhaps
the mighty Duncan and Alastair, of all the mighty
men who stood in that throng, could have as
much as stirred, but such was the strength of
him, and such his love, that the bars shook and
bent, then parted asunder from the walls that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
held them, and he thrust his body through the
opening and held her in his arms and often kissed
her and she him. But never a word he spake
though she wept much, and cried, “Alack, never
more shall I behold thee; never more shall we
ride a hunting together in the wild wood; never
will Torfrida fare with thee to the land of thy
kin.”</p>

<p>And fiercely she clung to his neck and wildly
wept when they needs must part them. And, as
they rode on, the tongue of Feargus was loosened,
and lifting his voice he called aloud, “Torfrida!
Torfrida!” and so called; and at first his voice
was faint and hoarse, but at the last so mighty
was the shout that the town rang with it. Till
soon she, and they who rode with her, became but
as a speck in the far distance, though still his eye
seemed to see her through mist and dust, and still
he called aloud her name that all the townsmen
gathered beneath and thought him mad, and
even the king sitting in his hall heard that wild
shout and shuddered, and as he lay in his bed
through the night it uprose, till the very winds
seemed to catch the burthen and shriek
“Torfrida!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FALL OF FEARGUS</span></h2>

<p>When those who had taken Torfrida into Lindesey
to her father had returned, the king sent for
Oscar and bade him release Feargus, and so he
walked once more a free man; but free or fettered
it made little difference to him at that time, for
the parting with Torfrida, and the oath drawn
from him, had well nigh broken his heart. And
much he longed to pick a quarrel with Osbert and
his cousin Edgar. Osbert himself was sullen, for
that his plan had been thwarted by Duncan’s
cunning, and, moreover, he found himself of
smaller count with the king. For Penda now
showed much favour to Feargus, as if to atone to
him somewhat; for the things which Duncan had
said in his wrath had opened the king’s eyes and
he no longer so fully trusted Osbert. But the
thane had a large following, as had his cousin, and
was, moreover, a leader of great skill, being, after
Feargus, the first captain of all his host, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
king could not throw over so powerful an ally.
So Penda and Feargus became friends as ever, but
Duncan and his men never forgave the king for
his treatment of their chief, though they kept
their anger to themselves. At this time Penda
went out once more against the Christians, and
marched into East Anglia, and there slew its
king, Anna, and laid its lands waste, giving its
cities to the flames. In all this work Feargus
had a hand, and he was grieved thereat.</p>

<p>It chanced when the Mercians had returned to
their own land word came that Oswy, king of
Northumbria, was arming, and that Sigmund and
many another king had joined him. So Penda
had hardly won home before he made ready to
meet them, but, when they were marching forth,
there came messengers in great haste, saying that
the kings feared to attack him and had turned
them back to seek their own lands. So the fame
of Penda reached through all the breadth of the
land, and his rule was felt even as far to the south
as London.</p>

<p>So there was peace, and Feargus, finding his
work done, dwelt more upon the memory of
Torfrida, till one day as he was riding the desire
to see her came so strongly upon him that for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
moment he wavered, and was for starting off
there and then to seek her, but he minded him of
his oath to Penda. And he wrung his hands in
despair, and once more set aside the thought, but
a great gloom sat still upon him so that he was no
longer bright or merry, but walked ever like one
in trouble. They were staying at that time at
Nottingham, and one night he arose and donned
his minstrel’s garb and took down his harp, and
said he—</p>

<p>“Why should I, for promise wrung from me
through my enemy when <em>she</em> lay near to death,
not see her more, whom not to see is worse
than death—oh, cruel promise! And what can
Penda ask as forfeit should I break my oath—life?
Why an he denies me love he may take it,
for without Torfrida life were of little worth.
Now shall I break that oath though all the
world henceforth call me liar and traitor. Alas!
I that never broke oath or promise—I who have
served my master, and fought against Christ
rather than desert my king and so break the
oath I swore to him and my father. Alas! that
I should have seen the day; it were better to die,
and yet will I not die, so long as Torfrida lives,
but will even now see her. Come, sword, thou wilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
carve a way to men’s hearts, whether thy master
be traitor or true.”</p>

<p>So taking his claymore<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in his hand he went
out and found Duncan, trusting him with his
secret, and Duncan said no word of dispraise, but
smiled and said, “May the gods speed thee.”</p>

<p>Then Feargus rode out into the night, and
entered the forest of Sherwood and, keeping the
line of the Trent water, rode northwards till he
came to the castle of Newark; here finding a
boat, he crossed the river and took his road eastwards,
and no man asked him whither he went or
whence he came, he being dressed in the garb of
a minstrel. And right cunningly he could play
when need was, for he loved the harp better than
the sword. On he fared until he reached Lincoln
or Lindum, wherein dwelt Torfrida. He entered
in boldly at the great gate and took his way into
the town, mounting the brae on which stood the
castle of Sigmund. Walking round the castle
walls, at length he found the great garden, and
there he placed himself where he might see any
that walked therein but might not himself be
seen, for he wished that Torfrida should not know
of his coming, thinking to content himself by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sight of her and depart. So shortly after the
evening meal he saw one walking towards his
hiding place: he knew it was Torfrida and his
heart leapt. Then he arose among the bushes
and saw that no person was with her, it being her
custom to walk alone. Long time he stood there,
and then the thought arose in him—why should
he not speak with her? She seemed sad and
heavy-eyed, and never again might he behold
her. Then thoughts of his broken oath and dishonoured
name held him back once more. Now
she turned and gave a little sigh; now her gaze
wandered towards the place where he stood, as if
her soul knew that one she sighed for was there,
though her mind knew it not. That look decided
his wavering—how might he withstand those
eloquent eyes! Softly he struck a few familiar
chords; she started, paused; he continued the
air softly, then stepped forth, and in a moment
she had thrown herself into his arms, weeping
wildly and too glad to speak. At length she
said—</p>

<p>“Now hasten thee away, for if thou art seen
the death of the spy will be thine, and none of
thy good deeds shall save thee.”</p>

<p>“Is this all, Torfrida, thou hast to say to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
one who hath thrown away even his troth and
his worship for thee—naught but ‘Get thee
hence’?”</p>

<p>“Nay, now, thou knowest that I would keep
thee and never send thee hence; but I would see
thee again, and this if any find thee here I am
not like to do, and—there! thou shalt have a
kiss for thy hardihood in coming. Nay, now,
let me go; I kissed thee, but did not tell thee to
kiss me. See, thou hast ruffled my hair which
is only now new done. Stop, stop, thou hast
taken kisses enough to last thee a twelvemonth!”</p>

<p>“Then thou wouldest rather that I took only
such as would last me a shorter time that I may
come again the sooner. O sly Torfrida! but
that I may keep in with thee I swear that these
I have taken shall last but twelve days, when
thou shalt see me again.”</p>

<p>“Nay, let me beg of thee—if thou shouldst be
discovered!”</p>

<p>“I can but die, and as well for Torfrida as for
Penda.”</p>

<p>So Feargus departed and reached Penda’s
land, but in trembling and like a guilty man he
went, for his heart lay heavy in him at the breaking
of his oath, and he found Duncan waiting upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
him. And Duncan seeing his master downcast
feared that he had fared ill and asked of him,
“What aileth thee?”</p>

<p>“Then thou shunnest me not, Duncan, the
breaker of oaths?”</p>

<p>“And what for should I shun thee: for breaking
oath wrung from thee in such brutal
wise!”</p>

<p>So Feargus was greatly cast down for many
days, but on the tenth day he donned his minstrel’s
garb and went out and found Torfrida.
Many times thereafter he went and greatly his
coming troubled her, for she was afraid lest her
father’s men might take him, and often she
begged him to leave her.</p>

<p>At that time Penda was staying at Tamworth,
the capital of the kingdom of Mercia, and his
men were making great preparations for war,
for king Oswy of Northumbria had taken upon
him the overlordship of East Anglia. So Penda
shook his white locks fiercely for, though the
winds of eighty winters had blown through
them and for thirty years he had fought against
the Christians and triumphed, yet his spirit was
unabated and his strength great. King Oswy
also gathered his men, with him going the East<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Anglians and Lindiswaras, or Lindeseymen,
with many others. And Torfrida was afraid for
her father, for though they numbered a mighty
host, yet little they thought of themselves as
against king Penda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE MEETING OF FEARGUS AND OSBERT</span></h2>

<p>When the host of Penda was ready, so splendid
it looked that no man had ever seen its like. By
the king on either hand rode a company of kings
and princes of royal blood to the number of
thirty. They were English of Mercia, king
Cadwalla of the Gwynedd, the British of Mercia,
Southumbria, East Anglia and the fens, and
even from Oswy’s own chiefly-Welsh kingdom
of Northumbria; with Picts from Galloway and
Lothian by the shores of Forth. It was a great
and motley gathering of Christian and heathen,
Angle and Kelt, and the king himself held the
centre. Osbert was sent on before to gather in
men whose dwellings lay by the way, and was to
join the king at the Winwoed near Loidis or
Leeds. Feargus longed to see Torfrida before
the battle, for he knew that she was in her
father’s camp and by the help of her brother
Edwy thought to get speech of her; so he sent a
trusty messenger to Edwy, and when they came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
by Nottingham he delayed and tarried behind,
promising to meet the king seven days hence
at the Winwoed field. So the king departed,
taking with him the more part of his host, being
the right wing and centre. And Feargus went
forth on his great roan steed—there being few
that could carry his bulk—and he donned his
minstrel’s dress and entered the wood. After
riding for four days he came near to where a
great army was gathered, then tethering his
beast to a tree he sat down. At the first glint of
sunrise he heard the trampling of a horse through
the dry leaves and Torfrida rode up hidden in the
folds of a cloak of great size.</p>

<p>“At last, sweet one!” said he. “Dark it
seemed while the mirk lay around, now thy
presence maketh all the world bright.”</p>

<p>“Nay, now, this is but an ill time for fair
speeches, brave Feargus; my heart is breaking
with ill foreboding—nay, kisses cannot comfort me.
Wilt spare my father, Feargus, and leave king
Penda; hast thou no answer for me save a kiss?”</p>

<p>“So little value thou settest on my kisses, and
yet the memory of the few thou gavest me,
miser as thou art, is always with me.”</p>

<p>“I ask my father’s life and thou profferest a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
kiss; these thou canst give me in plenty, but
thou canst not give me my father, Sigmund,
when the arrows of king Penda have taken him
once from me. A kiss for a life forsooth!”</p>

<p>“I would even now give my life for a kiss,
Torfrida, but king Penda’s I may not give.
What stirreth yon boughs? See! it is not the
wind, for there is but little, and hark, the sound
of hoofs! Torfrida, we are betrayed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say not so. Fly, Feargus, they are my
father’s men; fly, they will slay thee!”</p>

<p>“Thy father’s men or not, my red roan is
little used to flying. Penda’s men are only
taught to go right forward.”</p>

<p>“That shows how foolish men are; hide then
thy sword that they may take thee for a peaceful
minstrel, and I, thy lady.”</p>

<p>And so, guiding their horses aside behind the
boll of a great tree, they waited until two horsemen
appeared; at sight of them Feargus started.
“Torfrida,” said he, “we are indeed lost—it is
Osbert and Edgar; behind ride their men doubtless.
Caught with the daughter of an enemy,
sweetest, none will believe we are not plotting
Penda’s downfall, and Osbert will take heed
that none <em>shall</em> believe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Alas! thou wert ever too ready to run great
risk.”</p>

<p>“Kiss me, Torfrida, for henceforth I shall be
shorn of name and worship and the fellowship of
brave men, and thou wilt no longer wish my
company.”</p>

<p>“Nay, speak not thus; it is for me that thou
hast risked all things.”</p>

<p>“What cheer, sir minstrel?” shouted the
newcomers.</p>

<p>“And what ho! ha! a woman—thou sly
dog; but surely thou art a stalwart fellow for a
minstrel and great of limb; a better soldier thou
wouldst make.”</p>

<p>“A man wants but a strong arm to be a
soldier; a minstrel needeth heart and mind.”</p>

<p>“I see thou hast no stomach for the fight;
th’art doubtless faint of soul.”</p>

<p>“Not more faint neither than thou art thyself.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! an insolent dog! Little of the
minstrel is there in thee.”</p>

<p>“Get thee hence on thy journey; men of my
calling are not used to be treated as slaves or
sword-bearers; but for all that thou hast great
backing I am not adread of thee.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast a saucy tongue, knave. Here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
lead thou his horse, and now, minstrel, strike
thou a song, my men are weary, and if thou canst
not play then shall ye lose your lady.”</p>

<p>So Feargus struck his harp, knowing that it
would be fatal to him if the news of his disobedience
to his oath reached the king through Osbert.
So they were mighty pleased with his playing,
and all would have been well and the evil of all
that day had never been, but Edgar, who was
riding nearest, suddenly cried: “Thou art a
cunning knave, thou minstrel; thy lady hath a
graceful figure, surely she will be fair of face
also.” So saying he drew aside the veil that
covered her face and Osbert cried out—</p>

<p>“Torfrida!”</p>

<p>But hardly had the hand of Edgar reached his
side again before, with his master’s touch, the
great red beast of Feargus turned swiftly and
the giant minstrel, seizing his harp in both his
hands, struck Edgar with it so hard that the
dead face of him was such that no man knew it
for that of Edgar. And so fell the third captain
of king Penda.</p>

<p>Then said Osbert in great rage, “Stay, bowmen,
your hands; back, carls, <em>I</em> will deal, for he
hath slain my kinsman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the beast of Feargus swerved round
again and faced the thane as he drew his sword.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Feargus; “enough bale hath
been wrought already, Osbert, and I would that
thou and thy rash kinsman, whom I have slain
thus hastily in high blood, should be with me on
the right hand and on the left of king Penda on
the day of battle. Nay, I will not do further
hurt to the cause of our king by the slaying of
thee; but when his enemies are scattered we can
settle this quarrel—for I am Feargus.”</p>

<p>“Then have we here a traitor caught with the
daughter of our enemy, Sigmund. Long hast
thou deserved death, and now shalt thou have
it, for thou hast shamed me by the slaying of my
kinsman.”</p>

<p>“No traitor am I, Osbert, to Penda, only in
trysting with the lady Torfrida, else what need
had I to meet my lady in the wood, and in secret,
when in this guise I might have entered the very
courts of king Sigmund.”</p>

<p>“Defend thee, traitor,” cried Osbert, fiercely
drawing his brand.</p>

<p>“Nay, a tryst have you and I with king Penda
by the waters of Aire. Thou wouldst right thine
own wrongs at Penda’s cost, but such am not I.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then a coward I brand thee, and a traitor,
before these my men,” and so saying he smote
Feargus with his sheathed sword.</p>

<p>“Now, thou fool,” said Feargus, “thou shalt
have thy wish, for no other choice thou leavest
me.”</p>

<p>And then the men fell back and cleared a space,
and Osbert rushed upon his antagonist and plied
his sword until the sweat poured down from the
brows of the both of them, and yet Feargus
forbore to strike, for sake of Penda, and when
Osbert was aweary he said—</p>

<p>“Now for the king’s sake let us stop this
hand-play, or of a surety we will be too late to
tryst with him by the waters of Aire, for thou
well knowest that the king will not wait if the
enemy showeth himself, but, branding us both
as traitors to him, will fall to the fighting.”</p>

<p>Osbert made no answer, but, being breathed,
rushed again upon his foe, so angry was he to be
shamed before Torfrida and so full of jealousy of
Feargus. Long time they fought while the day
wore on, and then Feargus saw that unless he
slew the thane he would himself be slain, and all
the men marvelled at his swordsmanship that
could keep so renowned and fierce a sword-player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
off so long, for neither of them had any
hurt.</p>

<p>At length Feargus turned upon his foe and
they met together with a great shock, and the
helm of Osbert fell in sunder two ways and his
shield fell another and his sword was bursted at
the hilt and he staggered back as a ship starts
that hath struck ground. And then Feargus
turned aside, not wishing to slay him, though
like a dead man he lay for many a month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DEAD HERO OF THE WINWIDFIELD</span></h2>

<p>After parting with Feargus and Osbert, Penda
held on his way with all his thanes, and many
English and Welsh and Picts and broken men
came in to him as he fared northward. And
they marched until they won the valley of the
Aire at Woodlesford, where they crossed the
water and held on towards the Winwidfield by
the side of the little river Winwid, which runneth
down till it joins the Wharfe at Towton. In the
glen by the water they set their camp; above
them stretched the wild Winmoor itself, beyond
to the northward lay the great valley of the
Wharfe, surrounded by many breezy uplands;
southwards towards Woodlesford lay the Roman
fortifications of Seacroft and the Roman road
which cut in twain the wild moor that stretched
to the Aire water. And so they gathered them
in the glen by the Winwid burn to keep the
winds off them, for it was the month of November,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and that the enemy might not see their
whereabouts. There they waited for seven days,
till at length those who watched from the head
of the moor came in, saying that they had seen
men moving on the hills to the north-east. The
day wore through and the next, and they saw
many signs of the approach of the Northumbrian
host, but, though they should now have
kept their tryst with the king, there was yet no
word of Feargus or Osbert. Then king Penda
grew impatient, seeing that he might lose the
advantage of the ground by waiting. Another
day and doubts filled the old king’s mind. Had
his captains betrayed him? And his men were
discouraged, for much they looked to Feargus
and Osbert. That night a great storm burst
upon the camp of Penda, and the heavens opened
and poured down their waters in torrents and the
lightning flashed fiercely across the sky and the
thunder rolled down the valley, filling the minds
of men with forebodings. And the Northumbrians
saw from afar how the lightning played
fiercely over their enemies, and took heart and
were comforted. On the morrow the watchers
came into the king saying that the Northumbrians
were approaching up the northern slope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of the moor. Then the king said unto himself
that he had been betrayed. “And yet,” said
he, “little did I think them traitors; for I love
the youth Feargus as mine own son, and though
I have whiles been against him, yet I believed
he loved me, and held him too true to desert me.”</p>

<p>At the hour of noon the Northumbrian host
drew near and the king, seeing his old enemies
before him, arose and gathered his men. Then
the kings and royal princes that were with him,
finding him bent on battle, and knowing well
that the Northumbrians would not begin the
attack, came to Penda saying—</p>

<p>“We would counsel thee, O king, to wait
still until Feargus and Osbert shall reach us, for
of a certainty they will come: here are we face
to face with a host mightier than ours.”</p>

<p>Then the king answered: “And hath not the
host of Penda oft-times conquered hosts twice as
mighty as itself, led by greatest warriors of the
world? Strength lieth not in numbers, nor in
big warriors or little, but in the hearts and
minds of men. And how think ye it would look
for Penda to return back to Mercia without
smiting her enemies? Then would Odin say,
‘Our champion is fallen,’ and ye would all and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
all Northumbria would say, ‘So, the old man is
weak—age maketh him faint of heart and weary
of war; he is no longer Penda; let us unite and
slay him, for victory will be easy.’ Nay, I swear
by the gods to break the Northumbrians or be
broken by them this day.”</p>

<p>Then the Northumbrian king, seeing the
Mercian host moving forward upon them, took
counsel of his chiefs, and they sent out a party of
horsemen with a flag of truce and many splendid
gifts of gold and silver, and Penda called a halt
till they won his camp. Then the thane who
bore the white flag spoke: “King Oswy, and
with him the kings of Lindesey and of the East
Anglians and many princes, send greeting to
king Penda, and bid me offer to him these gifts if
he will withdraw his men to his own land; and
they will enter into a bond with him to sheath
their war-brands and turn them no more against
Penda or his people.”</p>

<p>“Go back,” quoth the king, “and tell your
masters that Penda recks not whether their
brands be turned against him or not, for
hitherto the turning of them hath hurt him little.
That Penda doth not want king Oswy for friend;
for the kings of the Northumbrians have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
yet kept troth with the Mercians, and will be
content with nothing less than the ruin of Mercia
and the overlordship of all the Midlands. Penda
is master of East Anglia, and when her king
bendeth his neck and leaveth the camp of Oswy,
and Oswy taketh himself back and sendeth his
sword to Penda and acknowledgeth him as overlord—until
these things are done Penda will take
no gifts, neither gold nor silver nor arms nor
mercy, and will give nothing but the cold steel.
For, mark you, the sword that conquered Oswald
and Edwin and Cadwallon and Cynwulf and
Cynegils and Sigmund hangs still upon my hip.
And tell them, moreover, that as soon as ye have
won back to them I will give my men the word
to bare their war-brands and no further parleying
will brook.”</p>

<p>And so they went back to their king, and
Oswy said: “If the pagan will not accept our
gifts let us offer them to him that will—the
Lord our God.”</p>

<p>Then king Penda gave the order for his men
to move forward, but they were much discouraged,
lacking the two chiefs, and came not on
with the old ardour. And the advanced wing
of the Northumbrians stood to meet them, Oswy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
himself in their midst, and the Mercians recoiled
before their doughty strokes. Then Penda
ordered the other wings of his host to come on,
seeing the battle must be either lost or gained at
that moment. Long time they fought, and now
one side was borne back and now the other, and
then at last, when Penda saw that the Mercian
host gained not on their foes, he gathered together
his horsemen and with them charged the Northumbrians.
Again and again they threw themselves
on their foes, but in vain; for the northern
host had vantage of ground and fought with all
the strength of despair, and they gan bear the
Mercians slowly back. And now all the play
was with the sword, for in such close grips the
two hosts lay in that narrow glen that the bowmen
had little room to ply their shafts. In vain
Penda urged them on and rode along the lines
himself, striking with the strength of youth when
any withstood him. Still they gained upon
them, until at length the Mercians, thoroughly
discouraged by the absence of their chiefs and
the numbers of their foes, turned and broke, nor
hearkened to the voice of king or thane, but
burst back and, casting away their arms, fled in
a body southward, down the valley towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Aire water. And ever the Northumbrians
followed, till at length they came to the water
by Woodlesford, but the terrible storm of the
night had caused a great spate, so that the
waters of Aire had overflowed the banks and
covered the low-lying land on its border. And
when the Mercians came to the head of the brae
from which they could see the flood they knew
not the stream, and being close together almost
in order of battle—so well had the king instilled
into them the habits of war—they dashed down
the bank, which falleth suddenly towards the
river, and plunged neck deep into the water.
Now for a moment they are stemming the flood,
all that great host, and many more are pressing
on behind them, before the swords of their pursuers.
Now the Northumbrians on the bank
above see them stagger, for little they had
reckoned the silent fury of that swirling flood;
now they are hurled the one against the other,
and wildly turn and try to win back and break
and fall, and the water whirls over them. And
now heads appear, and arms clasping others,
which may be near, and shrieks for help and cries
and curses rend the air, and the water is stirred
but a little for all and sweeps on. And never a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
man of that great host won the land. And their
foes stood on the banks awe-stricken, forbearing
to draw their bows, for it seemed to them as
though the God of the Christians who commanded
the new order had descended and himself
smitten the invincible host of Penda.</p>

<p>And then they hied them back and coming on
freshly fell upon the Mercians of Penda’s army.
But these were not among the flying; like a rock
they stood on a knowe a mile above the Aire
water, whence they had retreated in an attempt
to rally their comrades. In the midst of them
stood the king, a king indeed; tall of stature
and erect and of wonderful beauty of countenance;
deep and broad of chest, with white beard
falling to his waist. On his helm he wore the
raven’s wings—the sign of Odin, as the cross was
of Christ, for the king was of his kin direct, and
for thirty years he had fought Odin’s battle.
Behind him waved the banner of the kingdom
which he had raised from its utter littleness to be
the greatest and strongest of the English, and
around him were gathered all the flower of the
Mercian host, princes and thanes, and the whole
of the Albanich. And Penda had gathered all
these men together into a great ring, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Northumbrians charged them again and again,
but ever fell back, broken and beaten, and ever
above the throng arose the shout of “Penda!
Penda!” “Albanich! Albanich!” and only
the best men of Northumbria dare king Oswy
send against those cries. Shock after shock
broke on them, but still the men of Oswy recoiled,
leaving behind horses and riders with
broken skulls and bloody faces. And it seemed
as though that ring of men, calm and steady and
without fear, were to win the field after all.
Then Oswy bethought him, seeing that no men
in his host could shake the grim company, and
he called his archers in and planted them amidst
the broom and bushes on either side, and bade
them send forth their shafts. And so the ring
grew smaller, and as one fell another took his
place, then the king turned.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “cometh death, and I shall
die in the best company that ever I was in, for
never men fought better than have ye, English
or Welshmen, and ye Albanich, but it little
likes me to be caught thus in a trap, a target for
unseen foes, our bowmen having fled. Penda
liketh to hear the ring of his blows on the helmets
of Northumbrians; let this be his death song,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
therefore. Few though we be, let us charge the
host of king Oswy and die dealing death.”</p>

<p>A mighty cheer from the thanes and Picts was
the answer to this, and with the cheer they ran,
keeping well their ring, with the king amidst of
them. And they slew the bowmen, and then,
turning, charged towards where king Oswy stood
among his thanes by the burn side. The first
inclination of the Northumbrians on hearing the
war cry of Penda was to flee, so adread were they
of him, but Oswy called to them—</p>

<p>“See,” said he, “how the heathen host
waneth! Little have ye in your thousands to
fear! A handful cometh now against you!
The enemy of the Christian and of Northumbria
is in the midst of them! Now can he not escape!
On, on and at them!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus4">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="700" height="480" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“Now,” said Penda, “cometh death, and I shall die in the best company that ever I was in.”</p>
</div>

<p>And then the great host came against the little
and in a moment the Mercians were borne back
by the mere weight of the mighty throng in
front of them, borne back till they came again to
the knowe above the Aire water, but borne back
in order and unbroken, compact and fierce, to
deal death strokes yet to many a Northumbrian.
Then they took their stand firmly on the knowe,
and their foes came round on all sides of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and blows were struck hard and deep by Northumbrians,
and the replies came quick and strong
from Mercian and Welshman and Pict, each blow
dealing death, and all the knowe was bloody; a
wall of dead lay around the ring and still the old
king fought with the best, but ever that ring
grew smaller as the Northumbrian thanes came
on afresh when others fell. And ever the brands
clashed and rang and the crowd of common
soldiers below looked on in awe at the grim and
bloody work they wrought; for a fight of giants
like to this had never yet been seen. But on
the strongest weariness falls at last, and as the
gloaming came drearily upon the fields they of
Mercia were but a handful, and these stoitered
like drunk men and were hardly enough to form
a ring, till at length only one stood upright and
the king had fallen.</p>

<p>“Feargus! Feargus! thou hast not forsaken
us: ill hath befallen thee. Hadst thou been
with us the last Northumbrian would long have
fled the field. The king is down and thy work is
done, Duncan, though would that the hills of
Alban were around thee!” and so raising his
cry, “Albanich! Albanich!” the last of the
Mercian host staggered to the earth.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE FATE OF FEARGUS</span></h2>

<p>When Osbert fell, Feargus told his men to lift
him and carry him with them, and they marched
on, Feargus at their head. And Torfrida rode
by his side, for the day was too far spent for her
to reach her father’s camp; but Feargus sent a
messenger saying that Torfrida should be delivered
up to her brother Edwy at the place of
battle. And so they marched on through the
night, making all haste. But few words did the
lovers speak together, for the heart of Feargus
was torn by a horrid dread and great grief, for
he saw that he must lose all his worship in the
sight of Penda. And soon they drew nigh to
the spot where three days since they were to
have joined the king, but no sound of battle fell
on their ears, though as they came nearer, through
the mist of early morning, they espied the place
where were the tents of the Northumbrians by
the field of battle. And then the Lindeseymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
who lay towards the south nearest the point
from which Feargus came, saw his men, and at
first they took them to be another army come
against them, and arose and stood to their arms.
Then Sigmund spoke with king Oswy, telling
him of the love that was between Feargus and
his daughter, and king Oswy agreed to send
young Edwy to bring in Torfrida and to offer
fair terms to Feargus and Osbert if they would
join the Northumbrian host.</p>

<p>“For,” said Oswy, “two such captains are
not in all Britain, and pity it were to fight with
them and their host, which numbers but as a
third of ours. Tell them that Penda is fallen
and that I will give to both the Pict and young
Osbert lands and money and men if they will
join with me. So, Edwy Sigmundsson, take thou
this my message.”</p>

<p>Then Edwy went forth and Feargus rode also
to meet him, with Torfrida, for there was great
friendship between the three.</p>

<p>“I have sad news for thee, noble Feargus—Penda
is down and all his princes, and thine own
Duncan and all thy men. To the north of yonder
knowe they lie, with the nobler part of the host
of Penda, but the more part of that host the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
waters of Aire have swallowed up. And Oswy
bids me say that if thy men will lay down their
arms and join him, they being greatly outnumbered,
he will give thee lands and gold and
men.”</p>

<p>“Go back, gentle Edwy, and tell king Oswy
that Feargus, whom cruel fate and, alack! his
own folly have thus overthrown, is faithful to
Penda, and that Penda’s deathbed shall be his.
Gold hath no lustre to him, and his only laying
down of arms will be when the last of his host
or that of Oswy lies down death-stricken, and
Penda is avenged.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I am loth to take such a message.
Hath not enough blood flowed, and Torfrida—see
how pale she hath grown.”</p>

<p>“Never shall Torfrida wed with one who hath
disgraced his name and herded with the foes of
his king; my doings call for death. Penda hath
died believing me false, and him will I hasten
after that he may know me aright.”</p>

<p>“Nay, say not so—and all these thy men?”</p>

<p>Then the young brothers of Osbert who were
present stood forth, for they had talked much
together, and they said—</p>

<p>“Lo! Edwy Sigmundsson, the Pict may do as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
he listeth, but we are not of his host nor are
these, our brother’s men. We bid thee tell king
Oswy that we will join him on troth given.”
So Edwy gave them his word, and they and all
the host of Osbert went with him. Then did
Feargus turn his beast and without further word
spoken strike spurs; but Edwy caught his bridle
and begged him that he would stay for Torfrida’s
sake, and Torfrida wept. And when the two of
them looked upon Feargus they knew that he
was beside himself; and suddenly then he shook
Edwy’s hand from his arm, causing his beast to
leap aside, and quickly fled. Edwy saw that
Torfrida could ride no further, and he stayed
beside her, crying to his thanes—</p>

<p>“Haste, for the prince hath taken leave of
his senses. Haste, and by no means let him
slay himself, and be ye not adread of him, riding
without arms, for such is he that rather would
he be taken than strike ye.”</p>

<p>But Feargus was already far ahead of them,
and he fled toward the knowe above the Aire
water where the battle had swayed and waxed
the fiercest. Now he reached the spot where
the dead lay thickest—kings and princes and
thanes, many of them Christians long since, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
held together by the power and the splendour
and the faithfulness of Penda. There, heaped up
ring within ring they lay, true men to their lord—Angle
and Saxon, Pict and Briton, with men
from Lindesey and men from Trent and men
from the flat country of East Anglia—all dead,
with Northumbrians intermingled—dead—dead!
And there, within the last ring, lying all alone
in a cleared space, as though even the dying had
dread of him, and crept apart in their very
death agony, to leave him as he had lived, without
peer, lay Penda; his white hair of eighty
years bedabbled with blood, blood on his breast
and beard, blood on his sword, and blood on
his broken byrny—dead, the unconquerable
death-dealer! Nighest to him lay Duncan, and
around were Picts and princes together in the
last circle. Then Feargus knelt and drew his
father’s sword and laid it upon Duncan’s breast.
“For thou, brave Duncan, art more fit to carry
my father’s sword with thee among the dead
than am I, and I will die with thy soldiers’
brand in my palm.” And then he knelt down
by the king and kissed his brow.</p>

<p>“Not long shall it be, O king, ere thou wottest
that Feargus, though he hath failed thee, is yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
faithful,” and so he took his sword and made
to fall thereon, but as he raised his head he saw
the thanes of Edwy riding in haste and without
arms towards him. Then he sprang to his horse
and fled and they close behind him. And now
he wins the brae that hides the waters from
sight at that point, and now he disappears
behind it, and now they reach the hill but little
in rear of him, for his beast was aweary. And
lo! there was Feargus on the brink of the black
water, and now he has plunged into the flood and
the creature he rides seeks to win the side and
shrieks out for very fear; but Feargus steers
him amidstream, and now he pants and staggers.
And the prince threw his arms aloft, and waving
his brand cried, “Torfrida! Torfrida!”</p>

<p>And the great red beast went down and the
rider with him. And so swift ran the flood that
half a mile soon lay between the sought and his
seekers, and the bend of the river hid the rest.
Seeing this the thanes turned back to carry the
news to Edwy. And when they reached him
they found he was bending over the body of one
of the Picts who seemed to be still breathing,
for he had great regard for his mother’s kin.</p>

<p>“Where is Feargus?” said Edwy, looking up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Alas! he hath thrown himself into the water
of Aire and is drowned.”</p>

<p>“Then right heavy am I and sad indeed will
the lady Torfrida be, for to me he was ever as a
kinsman and to her, alas! such store she set by
him as never woman by man before, for surely
he was the noblest man and the greatest swordsmith
in all the land. And so was his heart set
upon Torfrida that he knew not himself how
much; and such was his love and his faith to
his chief that ’twixt love and grief for tryst
unkept he was beside himself.”</p>

<p>And when they told the lady Torfrida she fell
down in a swoon and lay sick unto death for
many a day, and ever in her sickness called upon
her lover nigh to the breaking of the hearts of
those that watched.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE WOODSMAN OF SHERWOOD</span></h2>

<p>So the waters that drowned the Mercians had
Feargus, and in a moment whirled him out of
the sight of the thanes of Edwy, and he was
carried down the stream till all the breath was
out of him, for no stroke to save himself made
he. And all that day men from the country
around had been gathered on the banks of the
river and had garnered a rich harvest in gold
and arms from the dead corpses of the Mercians
won from the water. And when the body of
Feargus floated past, the sun glowed on its
golden byrny<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and they saw that it was kinglier
clad than any that had come to their hands, so
they set about to win it from the flood, and with
branches of trees drew it ashore and there stripped
it of its buckler and byrny, and to get the clothing
from it they turned it about first on its back
and then on its face and there left it. So lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
on its face it chanced that the mouth fell open
and all the water ran out from it, and there it lay
all the night, and the sweet air filled it in place of
the water, and by reason of the great strength
that was in him the heart of Feargus rallied, and
the warrior turned himself on to his back and
groaned and murmured. And he lay there for
two days and two nights and then rose upon his
arm, for the breath of the were wolf wakened
him, and he seized the beast rudely by the throat
so that it yelled and fled. Then Feargus stood
upon his feet, but the past had gone from him,
and he knew not to-day from yesterday or to-morrow,
each being alike empty, and only the
sense of a great evil hung upon him so that his
brow was ever knotted. Then he felt weak for
hunger and sought out of habit for his sword,
but it had gone: they had taken all from him
save the plaid which hung in folds around his
middle and was then wound round his body. So
he drew near to a stout oak sapling which had
been thrown ashore by the water, and rent the
branches from it, leaving himself a club tough
and strong and of such weight that few men
could have wielded it. With this he lay among
the bushes till a red deer came past, then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
leapt to his feet and felled it at a blow. And he
kindled a fire and cooked and ate of it and
drank of a burn and was refreshed. Next he
set about to make himself a mighty bow of
willow, strung with sinews of the deer, and he
hardened arrows in his fire, setting flints in the
points of them and in like manner made himself
a spear, but no sword had he. In the forest he
stayed for many a month, but never could bide
two nights in the one place, for the fever of
unrest that was upon him kept him ever awandering.
All through the day he sat upon fallen
trees or down by the gowans on the wayside with
his head sunk upon his breast and the water
coursing down his cheeks, yet knew not what it
was that made him greet. And in the night he
would wander the forest through, or bathe his
fevered limbs in dark streams; and when hunger
fell on him he followed the chase, and so swift of
foot he grew and so strong of his hands that the
wild boar, the wolf, and deer found him a dreich
blow-dealer. So it chanced that soon there was
little in him that was like to the Feargus of the
lady Torfrida, richly clad and gay and strong.
His red hair hung to his waist and his beard fell
down an ell before him and wild and trackless as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the wilderness through which he strayed. His
plaid was ragged and faded, and his skin of the
colour of the ripened grain. Shelter he never
knew, but such was his hardihood that he lay
out in the wind and rain, through winter and
summer alike without scath.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">OF OSBERT AND TORFRIDA</span></h2>

<p>From the field of Winwid Osbert was taken by
Sigmund to his hall at Lindum, and when the
wounds that Feargus had given to him were
healed, he made a great friendship with king
Sigmund and became his man, for he thought
with the king’s aid so to work that he might win
Torfrida. The lands of Sigmund marched with
those of Osbert, and by compassing the death of
the youth Edwy and wedding Torfrida, he could
join the two lands and be a great ruler. And
Sigmund having so famous a captain to do his
bidding, with all his warriors, waxed strong.
And finding that his son Edwy set his face
against any friendship with Osbert and was,
moreover, not of a mind to make war—for war
he hated—Sigmund found little pleasure in the
boy and gave all his counsel to Osbert. Much
Osbert sought the company of Torfrida, and
though she would have kept aloof, she knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
her father wished her to wed him and dare not
thwart him openly. So he ran daily to do her
bidding and many services he rendered, thinking
to put her in his debt, but she treated him ill
until her father seeing, spoke.</p>

<p>“Thy father wills that thou shouldst marry
the prince Osbert who is a great and comely man,
and such as the daughter of the proudest king
might wed with.”</p>

<p>Then Torfrida said: “Never will I, who have
been betrothed to the noblest warrior of all this
land, wed such as Osbert, who was ever his
enemy and brought ruin upon both him and me.”</p>

<p>Then Sigmund was angry and many bitter
words were between them, and Torfrida wept;
but the king put her from him and showed his
anger in many ways until the life of Torfrida
became a burden to her. Then, through the
counsel of Osbert, Edwy was sent away across
the seas and had no choice but to go; so she had
no counsellor, and every hand seemed against
her. And Osbert only had soft words and was
quick to serve her, and so at length, as the
dropping of water weareth a stone, she began to
give way, for little she recked what befell her.
And she was so full of heaviness that she found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
relief even in the presence of the enemy of
Feargus, for her father willed that no other
person should have speech of her. And so when
she rode out Osbert rode with her, and though
she treated him with scant courtesy he still
endured. On a day it chanced that they were
riding by the outskirts of the town of Nottingham,
where they were then staying, when Torfrida
saw a group of youths gathered round
some object which they hardly wotted whether
to call man or beast, so huge and hairy was it.</p>

<p>“See,” said she, “what have we here—what
manner of beast is this? Mercy, it is a man!”</p>

<p>“What else is there that hath shape like to
that of man?”</p>

<p>“Nay, but never saw I man like this one.
Of a surety, prince, he must be mad—but see,
these lads will kill him.”</p>

<p>“Tut! the killing of him will be little loss;
but ha! ha! ha! he seemeth well able to ward
himself. Surely he is a giant.”</p>

<p>“Prince, I had a mother that was ever kind
and loved her kin, sure am I that that man is of
her race by what chance soever he hath come
here. Now, I beg thee, if thou wilt do a lady
service, save him; dost thou not see he weareth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the plaid of an Albanich—but quick, they
stone him—ha! what a lion he looks! Faith,
he is almost comely despite his madness! How
well he holdeth himself! Hasten, good Osbert!”</p>

<p>“Good Osbert! the lady flattereth; these
ears are little used to words of grace from their
lady’s lips.”</p>

<p>“Go, go, I beg thee.”</p>

<p>“Nay, most maidens would be afraid of such
a monster.”</p>

<p>“I tell thee my mother came from the Picts
or Albanich as they call themselves, that dwell
in the mountains of Galloway. I quail not at
my kin, but thou seemest to quail, so long thou
tarriest. Oh, had I but my gentle Edwy here to
do my bidding!”</p>

<p>“Nay, now will I go,” said Osbert, drawing
his sword.</p>

<p>“Put up thy sword then else will he think
thou art come against him.”</p>

<p>“I go not against a stranger unsworded,” and
so he went forward, little liking the task. And
then the wild man looked up and seeing a warrior,
all armed, riding forth, thought that he came
against him. Nothing loth, he burst out from
among the boys and sprang upon his supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
new foe. Seizing the horse by the bridle he
forced it back upon its haunches, and with his
long staff struck its rider to the earth. For a
while Osbert lay without movement on the grass,
such a dunt had he gotten. Then, seeing that
he was a great thane, some of the youths ran
forward and lifted him, and he started to his
feet, and his anger and shame were great, and no
sooner was he afoot than he ran at the stranger,
sword in hand, though the wild man held but a
staff, which Osbert judged to be his only weapon.
Not so, however, Torfrida, who had taken note
of the spear and bow of great length which he
carried at his back half hidden in the folds of his
ragged plaid. So when the thane turned fiercely
upon the wild man she thought of her mother
and of Feargus and his clansmen, who had done
so much for her, and her heart was full of pity
for him, and again she appealed to Osbert to
spare him. Then seeing he did not heed, she
rode forward, and speaking in the Pictish tongue
said: “Draw thy spear, brave stranger, and
defend thee, for a great swordsman hast thou now
to deal with, but shed not his blood, I charge thee,
for thine own sake; and if thou dost as I tell thee,
I will befriend thee and no hurt shalt thou get.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The man started aback on hearing his own
speech, and his strength seemed to fail him.
Wildly and long he gazed upon her, and his spear
shook as he made to draw it forth, and his knees
quaked and rocked beneath him; then he leant
upon his staff as one like to fall. But on came
Osbert, now mounted upon his horse. Then as
suddenly the stranger grew tall again, and too
late to draw forth his spear, quickly caught
Osbert’s blow on his staff, and such was the force
of it, that it was cut in twain. Then, sure
of victory, Osbert aimed his blows, but with
wondrous skill and quickness the stranger caught
them on the broken staff.</p>

<p>Then Torfrida cried out: “Oh, coward, faint of
heart, to attack staff with steel! Shame be upon
thee!” and turning to the stranger she cast her
own small sword, which she used for killing game,
at his feet, saying in the Gaelic: “Take thou
this; though it be but a maiden’s, much may
such as thou seemest do with it.”</p>

<p>Then the wild man, striking up the sword of
Osbert once again, brought his broken staff down
upon the head of his beast with such strength
that it reeled and fell over on to the ground.
But lightly the horseman sprang down while his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
antagonist stooped and lifted Torfrida’s sword.
Then put they their steel together, and the thane
was still sure of the victory, though greatly he
marvelled at the wild man’s length of limb and
largeness of muscle. And foot to foot they went,
and many a pass and downstroke did Osbert try,
but in vain; ever the wild man with his small
sword was before him, and ever wearier Osbert
grew, whiles the stranger waxed stronger, beating
down his guard. And all the youths and Torfrida
marvelled at such a wondrous swordsmith.
At length he sent the brand of Osbert from his
hand with a quick turn, and utterly abashed
before the lady’s eyes, the thane stood defenceless.</p>

<p>Then said Torfrida to him: “Badly hast thou
fared by attempting the life of a madman. Of
great quickness in swordsmanship truly art thou,
and well hast thou granted the favour I asked,
of this poor creature’s life—I wotting not at that
time how little it would be risked in combat with
thee. Nay, he might well have overcome thee
with the broken staff as he meant to do.”</p>

<p>Then Feargus took Osbert’s sword and her
own and offered them to Torfrida. And she
said: “Nay, keep thou the thane’s sword, thou
hast fairly won it, and it is well wrought and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
serve thee; and I see thou knowest how to be
gentle with women and hast obeyed me, and I
owe thee thanks for sparing the life of this
braggart. Thou shalt not lack a friend or any
that weareth the plaid while I can help. Follow
me an’ thou wilt, gentle Pict.”</p>

<p>Willingly he obeyed, and the lines on his brow
grew deep and his face became as that of one
who laboureth with some great thought, and
like a dog he followed, with his head sunk on his
breast, but never a word had he spoken. And
so he followed her thereafter in all her outgoings,
and at night lay on the threshold. And he
walked always with troubled brow, looking
neither to the right hand nor the left, nor heeded
nor obeyed any person, not even the king, except
Torfrida. And when she was present he gazed
only upon her, from beneath his matted locks,
and when she was away his eyes were ever
downcast and his feet knew no rest.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE OUTLAWS OF SHERWOOD</span></h2>

<p>And so the wild man was allowed to stay about
the court of Sigmund, though Osbert tried hard
to get him away, and even set two of his own
men to slay him; but the stranger broke the
skull of one and the leg of the other and himself
escaped without scath. Now one day it chanced
that the ladies of the court were out hunting in
the forest of Sherwood, which came down near
to the town of Nottingham where they were
staying, and they had no escort save one or two
pages and the stranger, who being able to keep
pace with a horse, so fleet was he, followed the
party. The day was bright and warm and the
sun shone down through the branches and made
all the forest gay with its splendour. And so
they rode on deeper into the wood than was
their wont, and they scattered themselves
through a glade where, the branches interlacing
overhead, the earth was streaked with soft sun
and shadow. Then Torfrida stayed her palfrey—gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
caparisoned and round of limb—and it
and its mistress sitting motionless, lost in reverie,
were so full of sweetness that a fairy vision come
hither on a sunbeam they seemed. But so
merry were the others that none saw the four
rough men who lurked in the thicket close by.
They were not of a mind and one said—</p>

<p>“Nay, now, if we touch her ill will befall us,
for either angel or elf-wife is she.”</p>

<p>Then one who was the leader of them replied:
“Ye foolish fellows, neither elf nor angel is she—let
not the woman bewitch thee with her
brightness, a rich booty she will be, for she is not
less than king’s daughter.”</p>

<p>He stepped forth and the others followed him.
Then the maids screamed and the pages ran into
the thicket, for their mistress was in the hands
of the outlaws of Sherwood, whose deeds were
ruthless.</p>

<p>“What want ye?” said Torfrida, steadily, but
turning pale as she spoke.</p>

<p>“My lady must away with us, and thy father
must pay us ransom.”</p>

<p>“I am the daughter of King Sigmund and
heavy hands will he lay on thee if ill befall us.
Thou mayst not hinder us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“That may and will we,” said the leader.
“Whatsoever king thy father be, I am king of
Sherwood,” and he placed a hand on her bridle.</p>

<p>All this the wild man had seen as he lay in a
bush hard by, armed with Osbert’s sword of
finest steel, but when the robber chief laid hand
on Torfrida’s bridle he quickly uprose, and
bounding to the side of the robber clove him
to the chin. One of the others then lifted his
horn to call his companions, but the wild man
dashed the horn from his hand and crushed it
underfoot, and then suddenly stooping, seized
him by the middle and hurled him strongly from
him, so that he lighted on his head and broke
his neck and lay dead before them. The other
twain, in sore affright at so sudden an onslaught
and so mighty a foe, turned to flee, but quicker
than thought was the sword of the wild man to
bite the brain of the third robber, and so strongly
he smote him that his body was clove in twain
by the stroke, and so fleet of foot and long of
stride was the giant that he that remained had
got but a score yards before his foe was upon
him and with a kick of the foot broke he his
back. So there was none left to call their companions,
and Feargus returned to Torfrida, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the pages came back also in great wonder, and
the ladies opened their eyes wide to see what
manner of man it was that had come among
them, who could scatter their enemies in so brief
a space.</p>

<p>“Great indeed is the pity and the loss,” said
they, “that so mighty and true a man should
have so little wit. Surely much sorrow hath
made him mad. A king’s son at least will he be.”
They rode homeward safely, followed at running
speed by their mad man. Then they went to
tell the king how he had slain four outlaws in the
forest and saved Torfrida and her maidens. So
the king sent for the wild man, but he would not
go until only Torfrida bade him, when he followed
and stood before the king; but he saw none, nor
heard nor heeded any, save only Torfrida, and on
her his gaze was ever fixed. When they saw
this some of the maidens wept for very pity and
sorrow, and they all praised him, admiring his
savage strength. And no person had heard him
speak or looked into his eyes, not even Torfrida,
for when she looked at him, so heavily hung his
brow in great knots under his matted hair that
his eyes were hid. So the king thanked him, and
Torfrida put his thanks into the Gaelic that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
wild man might understand. And when she
left the hall for her own bower he followed, and
instead of sitting at the door she bade him enter,
and then made her maidens bring water and a
comb and shears. Then taking the towel she
told him to kneel, saying in Gaelic: “A mighty
man of thy hands art thou; surely never saw I
mightier—save Penda or—; and if thou wilt,
thou shalt stay and be my watch-hound for as
long as I live, for right valiant and gentle withal
hast thou shown thyself.”</p>

<p>And he remained kneeling as she had commanded,
while she stood before him, and she
placed her hand upon his head and pushed back
the matted locks. Even as she touched him
the great man wept, and she combed and cut the
locks, and washed with her own white hands his
dust and sun and blood-stained brow, while her
maidens laughed and wondered; but ever she
combed and cut and smoothed his hair and
beard, which now, freed from their load of dust,
shone out like dark gold, and ever the great
drops fell from his eyes. Then suddenly she
pushed back his forehead with her soft white
palm and with the other hand plucked him by
the beard, lifting his chin therewith, and thus at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
length looked into the eyes of him. One deep
long look she gave as their eyes met, and then
she uttered a wild scream and fell back in a
swoon. Her maidens ran forward to her, but
still the wild man knelt there gazing upon her.
As he looked his brow grew smooth, his face
blanched, and his whole body shook as if palsied,
while great drops stood upon his brow, and he
breathed a mighty sigh that startled all who
stood near, and then he arose and, lifting his great
head erect, shook his locks, and in a voice that
made the roof ring shouted, “Torfrida! Torfrida!”</p>

<p>Then he pushed them aside and knelt and
lifted her, clasping her to him, and kissed her
again and again, laying her head upon his breast.
And his tears fell upon her like rain, till at length
she awoke and looked and knew that it was
indeed he whom she loved.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">AWAKE!</span></h2>

<p>Long time they sat, though little they spoke;
their hearts were too full for speech. And
greatly the maidens wondered. At length
Feargus arose, for the day was wearing late;
then Torfrida stayed him again and gaily ran
and brought a helm, bravely wrought with gold
and precious stones in the rich interlaced patterns
common amongst the Picts, and a sword and
byrny of like richness she also brought. Then
she bade Feargus kneel while she put the helm
upon him, saying: “It is not seemly that so
great a warrior should go uncovered. This helm
hath sat on the brow of a chief of my mother’s
kinship, and long it hath lain aside, being too
large for most men; but see, it fits thee like as
though it had been wrought for thee.”</p>

<p>And she put the byrny upon him and set the
great two-handed sword hanging at his back.
“There, no one will know thee; with thy helm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and byrny and sword of wondrous workmanship,
thou lookest as thou wert wont in the old days.”
She kissed his brow and called him her warrior,
and sent him forth. And all was lit up before
him and he minded that which had happened in
the past time. He saw King Penda and his host
overwhelmed, and his fight with Osbert and all
things else that had chanced since.</p>

<p>And he threw himself down in his old place,
but Torfrida, hearing from her maidens that he
still lay at the threshold of her hall, went out
and begged him away, for fear lest Osbert or her
father should know him. “Nay,” said he, “any
other thing that thou biddest must I do, thou
maid of my heart, for no desire hast thou that
is not better than I am, and no wrong can I do
guided by thee, but ever rightly and wisely; but
here, Torfrida, thou hast asked me to leave thee
and that will I never. We have had long leave
of one another already. And even if thou
lovedst me not, and had not the love-light in
thine eyes pierced the darkness my soul had
fallen into since that day thou wottest of, I
would not leave thee. Nay, Torfrida, neither
Sigmund nor Osbert nor any other shall part us
twain more.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MEETING IN THE FOREST</span></h2>

<p>After speaking with Feargus, Torfrida returned
to her maidens, telling them to keep secret the
knowledge that Feargus had appeared among
them. On the morrow Osbert arose and,
saddling his horse, took his way towards the
king’s hall, on the side where Torfrida sat in
her bower among her maidens. As he drew
near he saw an object lying across the threshold
shining brightly. Now for many months he had
seen the mad Pict lying across the gate in this
wise, and had tried to persuade Torfrida to turn
him away from her door; but she mistrusted
Osbert, and her father dreaded him, and for his
sake she had to hearken to him, but with an
ever-increasing ill-will the more he pressed his
suit. And Torfrida had felt that a kind of
safety lay in the mad giant who came of her
mother’s race. So Osbert had got used to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
presence, but as he drew near the door he saw
that this was surely no mad and ragged Pict
that lay in the gate, but a shining warrior in a
gold byrny richly wrought, fit for king’s wear.
As he stepped up the man stirred not. Then said
Osbert: “Now, sir warrior of the scarlet locks,
make way, for I would enter.”</p>

<p>“For what wouldst thou enter—the lady doth
not lack thee nor aught of thine?”</p>

<p>“Fool—where I am not, there am I lacked.”</p>

<p>“Lacked truly, but not desired.”</p>

<p>“Rude dog—let me pass.”</p>

<p>“Nay, no man passes here without leave of
the lady.”</p>

<p>“Thou art beside thyself, but now I am
minded that thou art him of the woods, that
erst ran ragged like as never man was afore.
But thou hast found thy tongue. What ho!
ye maidens of the lady Torfrida, hither and
move thy mad watch-dog, else will I do him
a hurt.”</p>

<p>Torfrida sitting within heard the cry, and
minded her of Feargus, and ran out, and lo! there
were the two men facing each other. Then said
she sharply to Feargus in the Pictish tongue:
“How foolish thou art and how rash! Seek ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
no quarrel lest ye bring ruin on the twain of us.
If they find thee out who thou art, then thou art
lost, and then will my death come also, for
rather would I die with thee, foolish as thou art,
than live a day with him.”</p>

<p>So Feargus paused and stood aside at her
bidding but sulkily, and Osbert stepped in.</p>

<p>“What hath brought about this change in thy
watch-dog, or I might say watch-tower, so tall
of stature is he?” said Osbert. “Of a surety
’tis a dangerous and unmannerly brute, and
sorely did my hand itch to thrash him.”</p>

<p>“Methought thou hadst given him enough of
thrashing to last thee: as thou shouldst know
the dog hath long teeth. And I warn thee that
if but a hair of his beard be harmed I shall know
that thy hand, or more like the hands of thy
men, have been at the doing of it, and never
again shalt thou sit aside the ingle in hall of
mine. This much will I do for my mother’s
kin.”</p>

<p>And so they parted, and Feargus lay still
outside the door, and Torfrida feared for him,
dreading the villainy of Osbert, for sore had he
pressed his suit that day, and she had repelled
him roughly, till he left her in anger. So when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
her maidens slept she arose, and went and looked
forth the window that stood near by the door,
watching the watcher. And the night following
she did the same. And she sent a messenger to
her brother Edwy, who, back from foreign lands,
was through the evil counsel of Osbert kept in a
far-off town on the border of Sigmund’s land,
where little life stirred, and there were none to
befriend him. And when the messenger gave
him the summons he set forth to meet Torfrida
in the Sherwood near to the hamlet of
Mansfield.</p>

<p>And Torfrida arose early before the day broke
and took horse, and with Feargus rode to meet
her brother. But Osbert had set a spy to watch
her, and he followed them clad in green from
head to foot that he might hardly be told from
the green leaves. And he lurked ever in their
footsteps, but kept well covered, behind bush
and bracken, for he well knew the sureness of the
arrows which flew from the great bow of the Pict.
He watched the two riding side by side, and
Feargus he heard talking, now in English, now
in Gaelic, as madman never talked before. Now
their horses drew together, and the Pict put his
arm around her, and so they rode. At length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
about noon, they reached a narrow glen where
they drew up, and he lifted her aground and
took her in his arms, kissing her and she him.
Then they sat side by side on a fallen tree, holding
sweet converse, until the spy heard the leaves
rustle and up dashed young Edwy, his horse
covered with foam. He drew up so suddenly
that the beast went back upon its haunches.
Quickly he sprang aground and threw his
arms about the madman, and the two wept
together for very gladness. And then they held
counsel.</p>

<p>“And,” said Edwy, “noble brother and
sister, I fear that much ill is before ye both, and
before me and my father’s house, for in the nest
is the gowk that will turn out the young sparrows
should it be thwarted of its prey, which is thyself,
sweet sister, a little, and the kingdom of the
Lindiswaras more.”</p>

<p>“Sorely thou comfortest me, Edwy,” said
Torfrida.</p>

<p>“It were better,” said Feargus, “that we
three should fly together, to my own Alban, and
come forth again with an army and slay this
serpent who bendeth the old man to his will.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Torfrida, “greater need hath he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
than ever of his daughter to comfort and his son
to deliver him.”</p>

<p>So they bade Edwy farewell, and departed.
And the spy, though he had seen all, had no
power to understand their words, for they spoke
in the Gaelic tongue.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE VILLAINY OF OSBERT</span></h2>

<p>So the spy returned to his master, and Osbert
was mortally angered and perplexed at the news
he brought him. Anon he went to the king, and
said he: “Lo, king Sigmund, thy daughter hath
taken up with a mad beggarman.”</p>

<p>“What may thy meaning be, friend Osbert?
’Tis a strange way to speak of my daughter,
for like to her there is not another in all the
land.”</p>

<p>“Neither more nor less than I have said is the
truth, king. The same beggarman that hath
been so long about thy court to-day rode with
her into the forest, and when they were out of
sight and hearing they held sweet converse
together, and the man cast his arm about her
and kissed her and she him. So they rode until
they met a second man in the wood, and they
three talked together in the Pictish tongue and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
then parted, and the two entered thy hall not an
hour since. And now the mad Pict or devil, or
whatever he be, lieth outside her door and is
like to kill any person that enters.”</p>

<p>Then king Sigmund was an angry man and
swore a great oath. “Had any other but thee
told me this thing,” said he, “I should have
said he lied. Now will I summon Torfrida, and
her mad squire shall die.”</p>

<p>So the king’s messenger sought Torfrida;
lightly she stepped out and followed him.
Feargus started also to his feet with his bow in
his hand, and when they reached the gate of the
king’s chamber the warriors forbade him to
enter, for Sigmund had asked for Torfrida alone.
Without word spoken, Feargus drew forth his
sword, and they deemed him still a madman and
feared his wrath, so let him enter. When king
Sigmund looked up he beheld his daughter, but
beside her stood a stranger whom he knew not,
great of stature and mighty of limb and exceeding
mild, but withal fearless of countenance; and
his cheeks were like red apples and as smooth
from good health and sober living—unlike the
puffed and bloated thanes of Sigmund’s court,
and his pale blue eyes glittered and shone as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
clear as precious stones. On his breast was the
byrny of a king worked with the rich ornaments
and bright colours of the Picts, and a king’s
helm sat on his brow, while at his back hung a
sword of giant length. And so noble and comely
he looked withal that the king stared upon him,
until recalled by the impatient Osbert.</p>

<p>“And who art thou, sir warrior, king or king’s
son, or whatsoever thou be?”</p>

<p>“Hold, king Sigmund,” said Osbert, “didst
thou ask the presence of this man, or didst thou
not say that none but the lady Torfrida was to
enter the hall, for none but she and I are concerned
in this matter. I ask thee in the light of
the promise thou wottest of, that thou gavest to
me long since, for war service rendered, that
thou sendest away this mad beggarman.”</p>

<p>“Beggarman he may be, yet saw I never
beggarman like to this, and few men even of
king’s blood. Yet Sigmund regardeth promise
given, so the stranger must hold himself outside.”</p>

<p>“King Sigmund, men say that thou regardest
an oath sworn, and I have sworn never to
leave the lady Torfrida, and I beg that thou wilt
give me leave to stay before thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir, thou art young and comely and a
stranger, and I would befriend thee and all such.
Nay, I would that I had many as honest as thou
seemest here at my court; but if thou hast sworn
so foolish an oath thou wilt have to break it, for
I have long promised the lady to my captain
Osbert who standeth here, so get thee gone as
thou art bidden.”</p>

<p>“That thou mayst have promised for thine
own part, sir king, but for the lady, she hath not
yet promised to wed this thane. If I leave this
hall without her it will be feet before, and there
will be others that will pass out along with me
in like manner.”</p>

<p>“Now, good Osbert,” said the king, “if this
man is indeed the madman who came in with
thee and Torfrida, it is ill parleying with him, and
he must remain, for I little like to bring in the
guards and make this matter public.” Then
turning to Torfrida, his brow darkening as he
spoke, he said: “What is this that I hear of thee,
Torfrida?”</p>

<p>“That can I not say till thou hast told
me.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou not know that they say of thee
that thou wast seen riding in the forest with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
stranger, and that this beggar or madman or
king’s son put his arm about thee and kissed
thee and thou him? Such disgrace was never on
our house before. And they say that the two of
ye rode on and met with another.”</p>

<p>Then Torfrida turned pale and trembled, and
then spoke: “Thou hast tried long to force the
thane Osbert upon me; know, my father, that I
have sworn to wed with this stranger and may
surely ride with him.”</p>

<p>Then the king started to his feet an angry man,
and Osbert drew his sword and started up likewise.</p>

<p>“Ho! guards, seize this madman, and the
madwoman also, and slay him. Guards!
guards!” cried the king.</p>

<p>Then sprang Feargus to the door, against it
placing his back, and drew forth his bow and
fitted an arrow thereto.</p>

<p>“Hold, sir king,” said he, “for an thy guards
lay but a hand upon her thou shalt die; for know
that a shot never missed I yet with this bow at
such range, and the traitor thane shall die along
of thee ere thy guards have crossed the hall.
Hearken how they clamour at the door. For
thine own sake bid them be still, for on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
door’s strength, which they so sturdily assail,
thy life hangs.”</p>

<p>Then Torfrida cried out in terror and called on
him to spare her father.</p>

<p>So the king was constrained to call out to them
to hold off, and they desisted. Then Feargus
stepped from the door towards the king, never
doubting his word given, and returned his
arrows to the sheath, but the word of Osbert he
had not got, and ere he reached Torfrida’s side
Osbert had won the door, and, bursting it open,
called aloud to his men. In a moment twenty
stalwart fellows were at the back of him. Then
Feargus, seeing himself outdone, started before
Torfrida and drew his sword.</p>

<p>“Hark, thou traitor,” said he, “an thou or
thy warriors lay but a hand on the damsel,
neither thou nor they shall leave this hall if but
king Sigmund will grant me fair field and ye will
meet me man after man. And even if Sigmund
hath lost his soldiership, then may I call myself
one that can raise a death pile in this hall, such
as men will tell of in the days to come, even
though the lady Torfrida and I lie sword-stricken
atop of it. And not the last to bite the dust
shalt thou be, O Osbert! Thrice have I spared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
thee, but a fourth time thou shalt taste the
sword’s edge.”</p>

<p>“And who art thou, braggart?”</p>

<p>“One whom thy villainy hath well nigh ruined.
I am Feargus of Alban, escaped from drowning,
and saved from mind-death by Torfrida.”</p>

<p>As though a thunderbolt had fallen at their
feet, or the sky opened ahead of them, looked
Osbert and the king, and the warriors nigh let
their weapons fall.</p>

<p>Then said Sigmund, “Now I see that thou
art indeed him whom thou namest, despite thy
beard; yet many of the thanes of the prince
Edwy swore to having seen thy death in the
flood.”</p>

<p>“Yet was I plucked forth the water for value,
methinks, of the harness I wore, and here am I.
And I claim thy daughter Torfrida.”</p>

<p>Then up started Osbert. “Hear me, king
Sigmund. Thou hast promised the lady Torfrida
to be my wife, and I will in no wise release thee
from thy bond given; but an thou deniest it my
men shall enter and slay all within, for they are
many while thy men are scattered abroad, and
the many will conquer, how strong soever this
madman thinketh himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“The king hath promised the lady to thee,
proud traitor; but it is the lady herself that hath
made me the promise.”</p>

<p>“Let the king speak,” said Osbert.</p>

<p>King Sigmund was much troubled, for his
regard went with Feargus, and he felt himself in
the hands of Osbert and would be free; but he
knew that war with Osbert was ruin to his
kingdom and himself, for so had the thane
thrown his toils about him that all the realm
was filled with his men. Then said he: “Much
as I have the weal of Feargus in my heart, it is
certain that ye both may not have the damsel.
That thou, Feargus, and Torfrida have long since
sworn troth is nought to me, for a maiden’s fate
is in her father’s giving, and moreover, if I had
in any wise promised her to thee, which methinketh
I never did, but always forbade, then
still by law of old time among our people, by thy
not coming to claim and have the damsel, thy
right is forfeit. Therefore the thane Osbert,
who hath wrought much for us with sword and
with counsel given, must have the lady.”</p>

<p>“Thou, Sigmund, hast called thyself a Christian,
and hast endured many strokes for thy
faith, yet thou wouldst sacrifice thine own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
daughter against her will in worse wise than
ever men were sacrificed to false gods by Druid
or at the death of chiefs of thine own race in
days past. The law of thy land is not the law of
mine, for there the wives are taken into the
counsel of the men and have nobler station, and I
will not bide by thy law who belong not to thy
land, but rather will I fall here.”</p>

<p>“Nay, be not rash, good Feargus; little worship
will there be in the slaying of warriors.”</p>

<p>“Then let the thane give bond for his men
and you also give bond for fair field to both, and
let the twain of us find justice at the sword’s
point.”</p>

<p>But Sigmund minded him of Osbert’s brethren
and kin, and feared worse might befall by
Osbert’s death than by his presence.</p>

<p>Then said Osbert: “Nay, the lady is mine
without fighting by the king’s own showing; if I
may not take mine own in peace then will I
bring my men and thou shalt bring thine, and
he that wins the field shall have the lady.”</p>

<p>Then said Sigmund: “Thou, Feargus, art an
overmatch for any man I have yet seen, save it
might be Penda in his youth, though he was of
lesser stature, or thine own captain Duncan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
little worship would be thine in the slaying of
the thane in single fight.”</p>

<p>“Three times hath my foot been upon his
throat, yet I have spared him for Penda’s and
for thy sakes, for all he hath ever done hurt to
me and mine, the like of which did to me no
other man. Canst thou then wonder that my
soul thirsteth for his blood? And I know that
the world would be the better of his killing, for
troth kept he never since breath he drew. So if
he will not let me forth the hall with Torfrida,
let his men fall to.”</p>

<p>Thus saying, Feargus fitted an arrow to his bow
and drew the string.</p>

<p>Then said Torfrida: “Now, king, and thou,
Osbert, if ye have aught of good in ye spare
these men’s lives; for an ye should not, ye will
stand in heavy need of them in some right battle
ere the days of ye be over.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;" id="illus5">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="480" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Feargus wrenched the sword from Osbert’s hand
and struck him to the earth.</p>
</div>

<p>But Osbert was now wroth, and the more so
that he saw his men had dread of him whom they
deemed a madman; for they knew him to be
the greatest swordsmith in all the land. And
when Osbert shouted, “Now fall upon him!”
unwillingly the captain stepped forward with
his men. And Feargus, who knew him to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
brave man erstwhile of the host of Penda, little
liked to slay him, so, letting his bow drop, he
suddenly gripped him by the middle and flung
him at his follower, and the follower fell among
the remainder of them, causing confusion, and
so in the strife Feargus gained the side of Osbert
by a mighty leap. Taking him unwares, he
wrenched the sword from his hand and struck
him to the earth, and laying a foot on his breast
held his sword to his throat.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “if a man among ye move
the thane shall die, and if you, king Sigmund,
give not thine oath and the thane himself his
oath that ye will leave the lady Torfrida and me
unmolested till I list to depart from among ye
Osbert shall die.”</p>

<p>After long pause the thane cried, “I swear.”</p>

<p>And the king swore and all the warriors were
witness thereof. Then Torfrida passed out, and
Feargus as he followed bent and picked up the
sword of the captain of Osbert’s host and handed
it to him saying: “Thou wert ever a true man.
I little liked to have blows with thee or to put
thee to shame, but no worship hast thou lost, for
never man but had his better.” And Osbert’s
sword he left lying so that the thane had to stoop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to lift it. And the captain was well pleased to
be counted of so great worth by the captain of
Penda.</p>

<p>So Torfrida went to her own hall and Feargus
lay outside across the gate.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE BURNING OF THE HALL OF EDMUND</span></h2>

<p>For many months Feargus dwelt at the court of
king Sigmund, and went wheresoever he listed
about the city, and Sigmund was much puzzled
as to how he might get out of so great a difficulty,
for Osbert was ever at his side with complaints
of Feargus and Torfrida. And so one
night it chanced that Feargus sat late with Torfrida,
for her maidens were singing songs and
holding great merriment among themselves.
When at last he went to be down outside the
gate as was his wont, he found an arrow sticking
fast at the foot of the door where his body would
have been had he left Torfrida earlier. The
next day he told Torfrida of this, but no other
person. And he saw that he must soon be flitting,
yet wotted not how he might depart with
Torfrida, for he knew she would not leave her
father. So he lingered, and ever Osbert urged
the king to rid himself of his troublesome guest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and let him take Torfrida to wife. But Sigmund
would not hear of any breaking of the bond he
had given to Feargus. When, after Feargus
had found the arrow, Osbert came to talk with
her, Torfrida denied him admittance altogether,
and he went to Sigmund threatening him with
war unless he would slay Feargus. Then heartily
the old king wished that the two would settle
their differences between them. So thereafter
when he heard that Osbert was making a trap to
catch his enemy, he took no heed. It chanced
at this time that Sigmund called a great hunting
in the forest, and Torfrida with Feargus and
Osbert and many others attended. When night
fell the party set their tents up in the forest and
lit their fires and made merry. Some way apart
from all the others was the tent of Torfrida,
outside of which Feargus lay keeping guard. It
was about the middle of the darkness that he
found himself sitting up half awake, and behold,
before him was a bear of huge size, and he saw
that it was held on either side by a leash through
which means it had been led to where he lay.
No sooner did Feargus see the creature than he
was wide awake, and, starting to his feet, seized
his sword and thrust it down the beast’s mouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
then stepping aside stabbed it with his skene
dhu and ran swiftly out among the trees, hoping
to find some of his would-be assassins, but
quickly and silently as he had acted, those who
had driven the beast on had been more swift and
had fled. On the morrow he told Torfrida and
again asked her to fly with him, and she was
much troubled lest between them they should
slay him, but still she refused to leave her father.</p>

<p>“Now of a surety thy father hath a hand in
this.”</p>

<p>“Nay, say not so; my father would not break
oath with thee or any man; hath he not lost
enough and fought enough for the truth?”</p>

<p>“I am certain, Torfrida, that thy father hath
at least some knowledge of this thing, and unless
thou wilt fly with me they will slay me by these
unmanly means, and Osbert will wed thee first
and overcome thy father and brother afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Nay, if I were to leave with thee then would
the thane more surely slay the old man.”</p>

<p>Feargus then saw that her mind was set and
said no more, but kept ever watchful, and let no
man see that he had any fear or suspicion, but
was open with all. And the thane Osbert waxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
more friendly than he had ever been, and even
sought out Feargus and spoke of him to all men
as the greatest warrior of Britain, and Feargus
wondered why he was thus friendly, and grew
weary with very watchfulness. And when a
thane, one Edmund, professed great friendship
for him Feargus was fain to believe him sincere
and he even went to his hall with him to sup.
So on a day Edmund was giving a feast, and,
thrown off his guard by his good-fellowship,
Feargus went with him and sat in his hall that
lay in the fens below the city of Lindum where
they were then staying. They had much jollity
and most of them drank deep. Now Feargus
drank little at all times, yet in the middle of the
feast he was overcome by the little he had taken
and fell beneath the board. Then, at a signal,
the revellers arose and left the hall, but Feargus
was unable to follow though he tried to raise
himself, and fitted an arrow to his great bow
lest any should attack him. When he saw the
hall empty he could move neither hand nor foot,
but fell asleep, and woke not till it was past
midnight and the stars shone amidst black
clouds without. He felt sore and stiff and sick,
like as he had never been before, and he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
not where he was, till he thought of Torfrida and
looked around and saw that the hall was not
hers, and he felt that the place was filled with
smoke.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “is the reek of a hundred
fires turned into this hall or whatever it be, and
I am like to smother,” and then the noise of burning
caught his ear and he knew that the place
was on fire. Half stupid still, he arose to his
feet and staggered across the floor to the table
and found water, and drank, for his throat seemed
all aglow like to a furnace. As best he might he
went stoitrin across the hall and felt along the
walls for the door, but when he came to it found
that it was locked. Then he pushed against it
with his shoulder, but it stood steadfast, and he
sank down beside it and sat upon the ground,
for his brain was not quick, and he could not
think what to do to get forth. Again he arose
and went round the hall and found at length a
pole-axe; with this he tried to prise the door
open, but in vain. Then, seeing the fire so
quickly growing, he took the axe by the heft and
began to hew at the stout oak. His strokes
were at first feeble, but at length the work
stirred the life in him and the blows soon fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with regular stroke and grew in weight, so that
the planks sent forth a shower of splinters and
rent and parted till at length there was a great
hole yawning in the middle of them. Then
Feargus became aware that there were men outside,
for a dozen burning faggots were shot in
through the hole. At this he was wrath and
remembered what had passed, seeing that he
had been poisoned and betrayed. He fastened
the buckles of his byrny, and, finding there were
so many foes at the door, climbed up to one of
the windows and looked forth, but the fire had
now a hold on the more part of the hall, and only
the hole in the door kept him from suffocation.
Outside he saw men stationed around the burning
building to prevent his escape, and the chiefs
themselves standing around the door. Among
them were Edmund and the brothers of Osbert,
and they had heaped faggots up against the walls
all round the building. He returned to the hall
and, lifting the skins which lay as a covering on
the seats, he wrapped them about his arms and
legs and feet and body and, tying them securely,
took a huge faggot which the thanes had cast
into the hall, and went to the door and struck a
few blows with the pole-axe. He then mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to the window on the side opposite to that on
which the thanes stood, and sprang outside
among the burning faggots. The skins kept his
feet from scath, and it was but a moment before
he had dashed through them, and, gripping the
burning brand in the one hand and the axe in the
other, he ran lightly round the corner of the
building and, with fragments of burning wood
sticking to his helm, and the hairy skins which
covered him alight in many places, with a fierce
cry burst like a demon of the fire upon his
astonished foes. There were Osbert’s brethren,
Thorkill and Osric, standing with the traitor
thane, Edmund, while two soldiers of the lowest
class stood one on either side the doorway. As
they turned to meet him Feargus thrust the red
faggot into the face of his nearest foe, and struck
the traitor Edmund to the earth with his axe.
Osric and Thorkill then rushed upon him, but
the one, Thorkill, was much hurt with the faggot
thrust, and, calling out for his men, fell back into
the fire, while Osric, not being able to reach
Feargus, owing to the length of his weapon, in
trying to avoid it was caught about the middle
and wounded. Feargus paused to pluck the
body of Thorkill from the fire and then dashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
headlong at the soldiers. These seeing one clad
in skins and all afire coming to meet them,
turned and fled.</p>

<p>“Alack!” said Feargus, as he freed himself
from his hairy covering, “alack for so much
slaughter. Gladly would I have spared thee,
Thorkill, for methinks thou wert gentler than
thy deeds, but he that herds with traitors must
fare with them also.” And so saying he laid the
two bodies and the wounded man side by side in
a row for Osbert.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WAY TO ALBAN</span></h2>

<p>Feargus took his way home with a heavy heart.
“Of a surety they will yet compass my death,”
said he. “The king wots well of this thing, and
it is unworthy of the Sigmund, who fought
against Penda for Christ. Penda the heathen
would have scorned such like traitorous work.
Woe is me for the house of Sigmund, for ruin is
before it, whether I be slain or not, and were I to
kill the thane, as I have his brother, then would
his kill come against us if they do not now, and
without warriors I could do little.” So he
reached Torfrida’s hall and lay under the lintel
but slept not. And when Osbert, passing in
the morning, saw the Pict still alive, terror seized
him, and Feargus eyed him sternly and spoke.</p>

<p>“If thou wilt turn thy face eastward towards
the fens to the hall of Edmund thy servant, thou
wilt find the thane with two of thine own kin
awaiting thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Osbert rode on northward up the brae
that made the centre of the town, and as soon as
he was out of sight of Feargus he looked and
saw smoke issuing from the hall of Edmund.
With sore misgivings he turned his beast eastward.
When he reached Edmund’s land he
found a few blackened timbers standing, and
those two lying on the green sward stark dead
and the wounded beside them. That day Feargus
went and told Torfrida of the trap that had
been set for him, and her fear was great lest they
should slay him, and he asked her again to fly,
but yet she would not.</p>

<p>“Then, Torfrida, thou wilt come with me and
take Edwy’s counsel,” and she was not unwilling.
So they sent a messenger that day to Edwy, and
the next they hied them together in the early
morn and found him in the forest.</p>

<p>And when he knew of the burning of Edmund’s
hall, “Surely,” he said, “my father hath a
knowledge of this thing. He must be in his
dotage, and in his old age is doing that which
in his youth he would have scorned. It seemeth
to me that ye must fly together, and the sooner
the safer, for the thane will not long leave his
kin unavenged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, Torfrida, hearken ye to Edwy’s rede.”</p>

<p>Then she looked dark, and said she, “If I fly
my father will be slain and thou also, Edwy.”</p>

<p>“And if thou stayest here then surely will
Feargus be slain, and Osbert will wed thee.”</p>

<p>“Nay, that will he never.”</p>

<p>“Once wed, Sigmund and Edwy will not be
long before they follow Feargus, and then
Osbert’s hand will be uppermost in the land of
the Lindiswaras; for Lindesey he will join on to
the land of his fathers and the house of Sigmund
will be no more.”</p>

<p>Then Torfrida wept.</p>

<p>“Nay, do not weep, sister; if thou wilt fly
with Feargus thou mayst have a good journey
to the land of the Albanich, and Feargus will
return again with his father’s men, and maybe
our mother’s kin forbye, and they will come and
smite the traitor.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I cannot leave my father, for he hath
but one daughter.”</p>

<p>“Though he hath wronged me and driven me
forth,” said Edwy, “yet do I love him; but he
hath broken oath with Feargus, and hath come
to break that law which is held most sacred
amongst soldiers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Much more did he say but to no purpose, and
they departed for home, and Torfrida was sullen
and would not speak more to Feargus that day,
but wept all the way. Before they had parted
Edwy took Feargus aside, and said he: “Farewell,
and keep and mark well my counsel—thou
must fly with my sister, and as she will not
listen to our rede thou must take her without
her will.” And so on the ride homewards
Feargus thought of the counsel Edwy had given.</p>

<p>Three nights afterwards, having got the Pictish
tire-woman who waited upon Torfrida to keep
her mistress up late, he arose at midnight, and
taking four fleet horses and many other things,
put an old cloak about his byrny and went
and knocked softly at the gate. Then the tire-woman,
who had been in the train of Torfrida’s
mother, opened the door and let him in, and he
found Torfrida sitting in the hall in the firelight,
and when she saw him she was angered.</p>

<p>“Now what bringeth thee here, thou tiresome
fellow? Enough have I not seen of thee this day,
that thou shouldst come in at midnight forsooth?
Get thee hence or thou wilt have my name in
the mouths of all the town’s wives.”</p>

<p>“Torfrida, there is no rest for me here, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
there is no gain to any by thy staying. Though
the ways to Alban are long and full of dangers
of beasts and robbers and tempests and cold and
hunger and weariness, yet not more merciless or
fierce are they than Osbert and thy father; for
the danger of them is open and declared, but the
king and his thane work ever in secret. My
beasts are without; let us fly to-night.”</p>

<p>“That will I never, and full often have I told
thee so,” said she. “Get thee gone, I tell
thee.”</p>

<p>“Speak not so unkindly, Torfrida.”</p>

<p>“Then get thee gone.”</p>

<p>“Thou canst not love me, Torfrida.”</p>

<p>“Get thee hence.”</p>

<p>“Nay, tell me thou lovest me.”</p>

<p>“I have told thee.”</p>

<p>“Nay, tell me again or I will think that thou
hast changed, so harsh is thy speech.”</p>

<p>“I love thee—when thou dost not worry me—there.”</p>

<p>Then he went to her and kissed her brow, and
taking a kerchief stepped to the back of her and
suddenly bent forward; as he did so the old
tire-woman came forth and caught her by the
hands and held her, while Feargus took the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of the kerchief and tied them that she could not
speak, then tied her hands together. Then the
tears fell from Torfrida’s eyes and she sank into
a seat and struggled to free herself.</p>

<p>“Nay, struggle not, lest thou hurt thyself,
sweet Torfrida; for I swear to thee, an thou
canst not trust me, that no ill shall befall thee,
but to-night we will take the way to Alban.
Nay, I cannot see thee struggle so; thou wilt
break my heart. Here, tire-woman, an she
struggles so, thou must tie her feet together else
will she do herself a mischief.”</p>

<p>And then he tried to kiss her, but she turned
her head from him, till at length he caught her
and kissed her brow and wept.</p>

<p>“Be not angry,” said he, “and greet not, for
great is my love for thee, and I swear again that
harm shall not come near thee as long as my
body hath life to be thy shield. And I swear
ever to worship thee both with my body and my
soul.”</p>

<p>Then he kissed her again, for that he could not
help himself, so had she bewitched him, and
putting a great cloak about her he bid the tire-woman
good-bye and taking Torfrida in his arms
went out and mounted his horse, holding her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
before him on the saddle, and they rode away.
In his hand he held his great bow with an arrow
fitted thereto, and as they descended the hill
and reached the last gate of the city a spy of
Osbert’s started up and made to blow his
horn to arouse the watch. Then the bow
twanged, the arrow sped and the man fell, and
Torfrida shuddered. All the night they rode
away northward and in the early morning
entered the woodlands. Then, escape being
hopeless, Feargus untied the handkerchief from
her mouth and freed her hands and lifted her
on to her own horse, but she would not look at
him but kept her head down and turned from
him and wept. Then his heart smote him—what
if he had offended her past forgiveness!</p>

<p>And she wept all that day, and neither ate nor
drank. And all that week they rode on, though
Torfrida would not ride aside of him, but kept
aloof and sighed and wept anon. At length
Feargus broke silence, and begged her to ride in
front, for he wished that she might be ever in his
eye though he gave reason to her that he might
see if harm befell her. So she rode in front, and
his soul was full with gazing on her, so great was
her loveliness. And thereafter she found him so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
merry therewith that she was angered the more
at seeing him so content to ride without her.
So she threw many hard sayings back to humble
him; then the big man was almost like to weep,
for the sight of her drew him one way and her
high words drew him another, till the heart
within him was nigh drawn asunder between
the sweetness of her look and the sharpness of
the words she spoke.</p>

<p>Then at length she said, “No longer will I ride
in front of thee to be gazed upon in this wise,”
and she turned towards the rear.</p>

<p>Then said Feargus, “Nay, now, if I may not
even see thee, I will die here where I stand.”</p>

<p>“Thou mayst die when thou listeth, but the
season is ill chosen for my comfort; it seems
thou hast brought me here to desert me and leave
me to the wolves—I would have fared better at
the hands of Osbert or of —— but ride not
over me I pray thee!” For Feargus had drawn
near in his eagerness to hear the name she had
on her lips; then he fell back and thought much
of her words, and had great fear, so that at
length he rode forward and cried, “Torfrida!”
And she answered coldly, “And who asked thee
to ride aside of me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sweet Torfrida, ’twas but to ask thee the
name of him whose name was now almost on thy
lips.”</p>

<p>Then she tossed her head half-saucily, half-tearfully,
and made no answer, but struck her
beast so that he leapt a good two lengths ahead.
So they rode on and one night took up their
quarters at a woodman’s cottage, and after
having eaten Feargus went out in the moonlight
to look around and found the woodman, and
soon learnt from him that they had yet gone but
a little way, and were still within easy reach of
the horsemen of Sigmund and Osbert. As he
was returning he happened to look to the left of
him and there among the trees caught sight of
a party of men resting upon the ground. Then
a feeling of hopelessness came upon him, his
hands shook, his knees trembled, and he sat down
perforce on a piece of fallen timber; when he
had recovered himself he arose and crept near to
where the party was camping, and saw that surely
enough they were the men of Osbert. Then he
hied him back to the woodman’s cottage and
stripped off his trappings, helm and sword and
byrny, and took them in his hands and bade the
wife rouse Torfrida. And when she had arisen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
she came out and eyed him coldly without
speaking. Then said he to her in Gaelic—</p>

<p>“Know, Torfrida, that I have been out into
the forest, and there lighted upon a party of
warriors of thy father and Osbert, who are
doubtless seeking us.”</p>

<p>Then Torfrida’s face turned pale as death, for
seldom had she seen him look so sad.</p>

<p>“And now, Torfrida, here is the noble sword
thou gavest me and here my good bow which I
cut from the forest trees in my days of darkness
when I had broken my oath through trysting
with thee and so brought ruin upon king Penda.
Here too is my byrny that belonged to thy noble
mother’s kin and like to which there is none
other.”</p>

<p>Then Torfrida’s heart swelled and she said
softly, “What meanest thou? Put on thy byrny
lest the foe come and have thee at advantage.”</p>

<p>“Nay, never more will I wear byrny or wield
brand: never had I pleasure in killing; unless
some noble quarry were in sight the hunt had
little to draw me. Take the sword and give it
to him whom thou lovest, and send the woodman
to the warriors of thy father and they will
take thee to Sigmund, and thou canst leave me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
or render me up that they may do as they list
with me, and thou wilt return to Sigmund and
wed him whose name was so lately on thy lips,
for whom thou hast been weeping; for I little
thought to part true lovers.”</p>

<p>Then Torfrida gave a sharp cry like a wounded
bird and threw her arms around his neck, and
with tears and kisses nigh strangled him. And
she knelt down to lift his byrny, but he would
not suffer her so to do but raised her by the hand.
She fastened the byrny about him and begged
him to get the horses that they might depart.
So his heart was filled with joy and gladness as
they rode away, and ever after, among all their
troubles, and though oft-times he blamed himself
for bringing her into so many perils, yet did she
never upbraid him but always helped, so far as

<span class="smaller">HOW THEY LOST THEIR WAY IN THE
GREENWOOD</span></h2>

<p>And so they saddled their beasts and sped
through the forest ever thinking that the men
of Sigmund were upon them, and when night fell
still they rode on, until at length Torfrida was
utterly weary and like to fall from her horse.
This Feargus saw, though she complained not, so
that he drew up and dismounted. Then he set
about to make her a tent with bushes and sticks,
over which he stretched the plaid he carried.
And she lay down inside the tent and he fitted an
arrow to his bow and stood outside hard by. At
about the midnight he was startled by the baying
of a hound in the rear whence they had
come. So he saddled the tired beasts, but judging
their enemies to be yet a long way off,
left Torfrida resting and went deeper into the
forest till he came upon a sleeping stag which he
slew, and cutting the skin therefrom fastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
pieces on to the feet of their horses, judging that
the hounds were following the horses’ track and
not that of the deer. Then he went to Torfrida’s
tent and said, “Sorry am I to arouse thee; full
well I know thou art weary, but arise I pray thee,
for now have they brought hounds to track us
and we must away.”</p>

<p>She arose and came out and he lifted her into
the saddle half asleep, and they went on, and
in their rear could be heard the baying of dogs
and movements of men and horses, and Torfrida
was sore afraid and trembled. Then, further to
hide the track of them, Feargus steered their
way westward through the wood, till after many
hours’ riding they won the river Trent, and
taking a grip of Torfrida’s bridle he caused the
beasts to plunge in and they swam strongly till
they reached the shore. They entered there the
forest of Sherwood, which was deeper than that
through which they had come and full of swamps
and devious ways and beasts and robbers.
Little he liked to enter it, and he wrapped the
cloak close around Torfrida as though she were
a youth and put a man’s bonnet on her brow and
bound a white cloth about her forehead, as
though she were sick of a wound. Then out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
his wallet he took an old dress, much worn but
strong, like to the habit of a medicine man, and
set it over his byrny, and such a sorry couple
they made as it little would profit to rob. So
they held on laboriously for three days, not
daring to linger long in one place, but striking
ever northwards through the greenwood. On
the fourth day so weary was Torfrida that
Feargus would have her to rest well, and in
the dusk of evening they came to a stand in a
glade of wondrous beauty nigh to where a burn
ran, and were for resting there. He made the
tent for Torfrida and cooked and ate of the stag’s
flesh which he had slain and drank of the burn.
Then, having eaten, Feargus took his sword and
bow and went to look around, following the
burn. He had gone but a stone’s throw from
where they had set their camp when to his great
amaze he saw a sheet of water stretching before
him; he looked to the right hand and to the left
down the broad stream. On the opposite bank
was a forest, but of not such density as the Sherwood
in which he stood. Where had he seen
that place before? His heart leapt, for lo! they
had come again to the spot at which they had
crossed Trent water four days since! Then his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
courage failed him and he leant against a tree
and nigh wept. So long he stood that Torfrida,
wondering what kept him, followed his track yet
visible in the soft earth, and came upon him and
marvelled, so still he stood, till she beheld the
water and knew the place, and threw herself upon
his neck, and they stood there long together
without speech.</p>

<p>“Better would it be, Torfrida, for thee if thou
didst cross once more Trent water and seek thy
father, for great travail will be ours or we win
the land of the bens, if ever we reach it; for
much I doubt whether we may win so far north.”</p>

<p>“Nay, then thou wilt have an arrow for each
of us.”</p>

<p>“An thou art so bravely minded, to-morrow
we will rest and the next day hold on, and methinks
here is a clear space by Trent side and,
though if we ride along the water we will go too
far to the east, I can here see the heavens and
may pilot our way by the stars.” So they
rested and then on for many a league, going oftentimes
miles about for want of a path, and for
fear of moss and water and thicket impassable.
It chanced as they were riding one evening by
Trent they saw a small boat flit from under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
opposite bank and strike across towards them.
In it were three men clad in forest green, so that
it was hard to tell them amongst the green
leaves. Feargus sprang aground and ran swiftly
forward, ere they knew him ware of their
presence. Then with bow fixed he hailed them.
“Ho! ye men in green. I give ye warning that
he who but a bow raises shall lift bow no more
for many days—halt, I say.”</p>

<p>He who sat in the bow seized his arrows, however,
and fitted one, then Feargus let his arrow
forth and lo! it struck the man through the
hand, and his bow had hardly slipped from his
grasp ere another struck the side of the boat and
pierced it.</p>

<p>“Now canst thou see what manner of bowman
am I? hold, therefore, or by my next shot
you will find yourselves in Trent. Then will I
slay ye as ye swim to land.”</p>

<p>Then said he of the wounded hand, “This is
no mortal man but a giant; saw ye ever the like
or bow of so great size? Little profit were it
to fight with him.” Then he said to Feargus,
“Now, good master, what wilt thou of us?
thou art a goodly bowman and we would land,
for our boat hath a rent in her such as no bowman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of mine could have made in so stout a
craft.”</p>

<p>“I ask a safe free passage through the forest.”</p>

<p>“That we promise thee.”</p>

<p>“I lack a guide also to lead me, and another
with him as a surety for his good faith and that
of thy men. And if he betray me then will I cut
the throats of ye both.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast shot me through the hand, I
would avail little against my own foes.”</p>

<p>“Thou shalt not lack such defence as I can
give thee against thine enemies as long as thou
servest me.”</p>

<p>“Thou speakest fair, an thou wilt let us land
we will take thy terms.”</p>

<p>“Then let the three of ye land, and give me
thy troth and let thy men do likewise.”</p>

<p>“I swear by the old gods and by the new
God.”</p>

<p>“And I.” “And I.”</p>

<p>So they landed, and Feargus tied the man’s
hands behind him, but the wounded captain he
let free, after binding his wound. And he made
them walk before him and kept an arrow in his
hand ready. And so at last they left the Trent
and struck north and west through the forest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
towards the lands of the Northern English
beyond Mansfield. When they reached the
forest marge, Feargus gave the captain his bow
to defend him with, and let the green men go
free. And they rode out through the lands of
the North English who were once Penda’s men,
and soon found themselves well out of the forest
and won a good road and followed it and came to
a turning and there found a hostel where wayfarers
might find rest and meat. So they entered
and ate heartily. But soon a crowd collected
outside, so wild were their looks, and so giant-like
Feargus and rode such a monstrous beast, though
the creature had little else to recommend him to
a stranger, for Feargus had let him run wild and
left him mud-stained to hide his worth, though
food or other care he never lacked and ate ever
before his master had eaten. Then the people
gan asking Torfrida who her master might be
and much ado she had to silence them, and
Feargus began to fear that they might not safely
stay in that hostel. Yet he little liked turning
out again into the night, he being heavy for
lack of sleep, for while the green men were with
them he had got no rest, but ever had to watch
that they did not betray them. And so as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
supped it chanced that, hearing of the strange
people who had come into the town, there entered
some soldiers who had fought for Penda, and
Feargus knew them quickly. And they eyed
him askance. And one of them, Godfree by
name, had been a captain in Feargus’s host in
former days, and he had intelligence beyond the
others, though his temper was evil. This man
now came and stood near to them with knitted
brow, as though thinking to solve some difficulty,
and so till Feargus spoke; when he heard his
voice the man started as though the earth had
opened at his feet. Then with mouth agape and
eyes starting from their sockets he backed to the
door. All those that stood there looked on
amazed.</p>

<p>“What seest thou?” said they.</p>

<p>“I see the ghost of him who betrayed our
king, the mighty Penda,” he gasped, “Feargus
the Pict; but it is surely no ghost—it is Feargus,
men. Slay him, the traitor! Down with him!”</p>

<p>Then Torfrida thought that all was lost, but
Feargus arose with a bound and won the door
before they could reach it and there stood with
bow drawn, but he wished not to slay any, for
he well knew that they would then follow him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and, turning to Torfrida, he said in Gaelic, “Canst
thou run and fetch the beasts to the door; no
danger thou wilt meet, for none shall leave this
hostel to tell those without till thou returnest.”</p>

<p>“That can I,” said Torfrida, and soon came
back with the beasts and waited without. When
Feargus reached the door and faced the men who
were for leaving the hostel, his mighty bow
drawn and a huge wooden table standing before
him as a barrier, the captain, Godfree, stayed in
his course, so likewise the others, looking to him
for the lead. Godfree well knew the strength of
Feargus and what things he had done, and the
fame of him held the others in awe also. For
they knew that though they might slay him,
there would be few of their company left after
it was done.</p>

<p>Then said he, “Hearken to me—never did
Feargus betray Penda, but it is of common
knowledge and was witnessed by many that he
met the prince Osbert in a wood, and albeit he
wished not to fight lest he should be too late to
come up and keep tryst with Penda, Osbert
forced him to it, and so the king failed for lack
of men. Never did I betray him, for that I
loved the king.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“He lies,” roared Godfree, recovering himself.
“He hath ruined Mercia,” and then they
all came forward clamouring, and so great was
the noise that the townspeople came out and
lined the road. Then Feargus knew that he must
wait no longer, but strode through the door, and
it had hardly closed on the heel of him ere he
was astride his horse, and the two dashed down
the street midst a shower of stones from the
houses. As no one knew save the men behind
why they fled or who they were no one stopped
them, so they won the moor outside the town,
and there drew up. Then Feargus turned to
Torfrida and sighed, for she looked pale for want
of rest, and frightened, and he took her by the
hand, saying, “Once more, Torfrida. Thanks
to thee.”</p>

<p>“Nay, without thy quickness and thy courage
I could have done nothing.”</p>

<p>“And now, Torfrida, I see not which way
there is left for us to turn; for if the North
Angles knew me so also will the men of Elmet<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and Northumbria. But an we do not enter
Northumbria there remains nothing but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
wilds that lie to the north-west in South Strathclyde
and Cumbria, where no man is, nor food,
nor bield nor bush to shelter us from the wind,
nor anything but moss and moor. We have
been many days in coming this little gate, and if
the rest of the way is as long to tread, then will
winter be upon us ere we enter the wild country.”</p>

<p>“Then let us still try Northumbria, for there
at least are men and women and we may get
through.”</p>

<p>“So shall it be, Torfrida, an thou art so brave
to bear the risk.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">THEIR ADVENTURES AMONG THE NORTH
ENGLISH</span></h2>

<p>So they turned them north again and held on
till they came upon a town. This time, not
entering any hostel, they bought food and took
it with them, with fodder for the beasts, and
found a small wood that stood on the outskirts.
Feargus here made Torfrida her tent again and
set a fence around about with prickly whin and
other bushes and brought the two beasts inside.
And he lay down by his own horse and watched
and ever and again rose and walked round and
saw that all was still, but slept not, such little
sleep as he got being by day when Torfrida could
sit watching. So it fell that he was in sore need
of rest and they stayed there three days. As
soon as morning broke Torfrida would rise and
go outside and watch while Feargus fell to sleeping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and sweet was that rest to him. On the
fourth day while Torfrida was watching she
noticed that some men of the village were looking
down upon them. At length, seeing no one
stirring, they drew nearer and beheld Feargus,
and gazed at him, agape at his thew and sinew.</p>

<p>“Now, good master, tell us what manner of
man is this, for never yet saw we the like of him—surely
he is more of warrior than of leech.”</p>

<p>“Go ye not too near unto him, lest ye disturb
his sleep, for little might the twain of ye do
against him ah ye hurtled with him.”</p>

<p>“Nay, young master, but we are many; he is
one.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I see but two of ye.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but others fill the forest and they have
sent us to ask of him whether it be true as they
say, that he is Feargus through whom king
Penda was slain, for so we are told by men of
the North English.”</p>

<p>Then Torfrida turned and went within the
barrier, saying, “Surely he will best answer you
himself.” And so she said to Feargus in Gaelic,
“Arise, beloved one, for our troubles seem but
begun; arise and lift with thee thy bow with
arrow ready, for our foes are about us on every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
hand. Safer I doubt we would be among the
wolves of the west than here.”</p>

<p>Then Feargus arose and stood before his
enemies.</p>

<p>“What dost want?” said he, “that I may
not be left in peace here in the greenwood?”</p>

<p>“They say thou art Feargus the Pict, the
captain of king Penda.”</p>

<p>“And what if I be Feargus: what is’t that I
owe thee?—nothing. Forget ye not that Osbert
would not wait but forced me to fight, and so we
both broke tryst with the king at the last, yet I
served him right well—as well as the best of ye
his own kin; and my men, who knew that Feargus
would never desert his master, thought me dead
and all died for Penda and stood to him saving
his name when his own Mercians fled and left
him. And what did Feargus himself do? Did
not the king say that he it was who won the fight
with king Sigmund by Trent water and at Mansfield
town, and he had no small share in the
victory at Camulodunum over king Anna of the
East Anglians. So what is’t that he owes ye?”</p>

<p>“Aye, but Feargus lost the cause at the last,
so that all his deeds were of little profit. He is
a traitor and we will slay him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then gather all thy comrades that are about
the forest together, and when ye are all gathered
then hear me; and if I cannot prevail on ye, ye
must slay me.”</p>

<p>“Nay, we will not gather them together, lest
they being withdrawn ye might escape.”</p>

<p>“Then move ye not a hand but set ye your
minds in order.”</p>

<p>“And why so, master?”</p>

<p>“Because an ye call not your comrades together
they shall call not you so sound will ye
both sleep, for these arrows shall fly to the hearts
of ye. Ye wot Feargus was ever a man of his
word save only that once when he failed through
fate to tryst with Penda. Nay, an ye call for
help or move ye shall die e’er help can reach
ye.”</p>

<p>“Spare us, noble Feargus, for we are men who
have wives and young bairns.”</p>

<p>“Gather your townsmen or die ere this stone
reaches earth again, and if any man of yours
lifts bow or brand I will slay thee,” said he,
throwing high a great pebble.</p>

<p>“We will do as ye command,” said they.</p>

<p>So they wound their horns and in from every
quarter came soldiers and villagers, each man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
armed to the teeth, for as Feargus had seen,
they had surrounded them and left to the chief
man of the town the work of bearding the noble
quarry. Then, when they were all gathered,
Feargus, with bow stretched, whistled soft, and
as if by his own will his great white horse arose
and came to him, and then said he to Torfrida
in the Gaelic, “Now run to thy beast and mount;
leap then the fence and ride straight into the
forest, the road is clear, and when thou canst
just see me in the distance, wait, that I may not
lose thee.”</p>

<p>Then before the astonished soldiers could stir
she leapt the bushes in the rear, gathering her
plaid and tent up as she went, and made for the
wood, and in a moment was out of sight. There
was a slight movement among the villagers, and
some shouted, “Take him, he will escape.” But
Feargus drew back the string of that mighty bow
till the chief man’s son cried, “Stay, stay, or he
will slay my father!” while the old man trembled.
Then Torfrida blew her whistle, and promptly
Feargus leapt on to his horse and, sitting with
back to the beast’s head, kept his arrow fixed on
the old man. Then, speaking a word to the
beast, it dashed through the fence in the track<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of its fellow; and the angry villagers saw them
depart, but might not follow for fear of that
terrible bow. When he had quite disappeared
they took horse and lifted horn and rode after
him, for greatly were they put to shame at being
outwitted through fear for one man. So they
rode and ran and raised a great hue and cry.
But Feargus and Torfrida rode on nor stopped
until Torfrida was faint for very weariness.
Then said Feargus, “Here let us draw up, for
thou art much distressed, and so withal are the
poor beasts. To-morrow we must on again—little
rest is there for us or them.” He gathered
whin in the open and other bushes and made a
fence and put Torfrida and also the beasts within,
kindling a fire to scare the wild creatures. Then
he went forth to gather food for the horses, sweet
grasses, and corn which he had bought in the
village. And he came upon a deer and shot it
and cut it up and cooked it, and they ate with
great heartiness. And the beasts lay still beside
him, so tame were they grown, and so keen were
their ears they could tell from afar the coming of
any wild creature, and then Feargus would rise
up with his sword and lift a faggot to scare it.
But so keen did Feargus himself soon become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
that no sound or mark escaped him. So it was
that he kept out of the track of men, until after
wandering through mire and moss they drew
out of the lands of the North English, thinking
to enter the great wild which lay between Lune
and Wharfe and stretched well nigh to Solway
and the western seaboard. And they struck
across the moorlands of Wharfe towards Cumbria,
but so heavy was the road that the days
came and went and saw them but little on their
path. Oft-times they despaired of ever seeing
Alban, and their hearts were heavy when they
thought of all the gate they had yet to go. And
ever the winter drew nearer and filled Feargus
with dread. So they strayed among the glens,
and every night he would find a place of safety
for Torfrida. Sometimes he would make her a
tent among the whins and bracken, sometimes
would stretch over the heather the skins of the
many animals he had slain; at times in caves or
’mongst the rocks of some mountain or cataract
he stretched her tent on stakes of wood and
there she would sleep serene. Then he would set
forth on foot in search of food. So on they sped,
lying now on the bare brae side, now in wild
glens, ever faring northward. And the nights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
grew cold and the snell wind swept keen up the
glens or over the bleak braes, and now the wolves
and wild beasts drew nearer at night, for the
frost fell upon the earth and left them scant of
food.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW FEARGUS FELL AMONG THIEVES</span></h2>

<p>It chanced one night that Feargus went forth
on foot and wandered over the moors, finding
nothing for his arrows. And his white horse
followed him like a dog, now stopping a hundred
paces behind to crop the grass, now running
forward as it listed. At length, being weary,
Feargus sat him down not noticing that hard by
him were the remains of a camp fire. He laid
his sword aside him and unloosened his harness
and fell to thinking, and was right sad when he
minded him of all Torfrida had come through
for his sake. “Better,” said he, “would it have
been had I died by Osbert’s hands, in sooth.”
Then suddenly he got a blow on the head and was
seized by each shoulder, while a man stepped
forward and lifted his sword and turned it against
him.</p>

<p>“Now yield ye, sir Redbeard, for whoever
thou be,” said one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Feargus seized the one who held his
right arm and swung him to the earth and the
one to the left he struck with his clenched fist
and then dashed upon him who held the sword,
but the robber instantly struck him with it in
the shoulder that the blood spurted forth, and
then another ran forward with a bow and fitted
an arrow thereto and made to shoot him. Then
Feargus paused, for he thought what would
befall Torfrida alone on the moor, and he felt
the blood running from him, for he had had his
byrny unloosed as also the shirt of mail that clad
him to the elbow, so that he had no defence
against his foes. Then he reasoned that it would
be better to give way now and escape afterwards
if chance offered. So he allowed them to bind
his hands, whereupon those whom he had hurt
fell upon him and beat him sorely, stripping off
his byrny, and ever he bled; but when they
went to lift his shirt of mail from him he said,
“Coward swordsmiths are ye, for ye have beaten
a wounded foe who is a prisoner and without
arms, and now go for to strip him of his mail
though the night be keen for a whole man and
worse for a wounded one, and it will do ye little
good for there is not one among your company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
who is of size to wear it.” Then one who was
the captain among them struck him upon the
mouth in answer. Feargus uttered an oath in
Gaelic, whereupon the captain again struck him,
and then they took him one on either side and
walked on, but one of the company came forward
drawing forth a kerchief. “Better he would
walk, perchance,” said he, “if the blood were
staunched, for he groweth faint and hard work
were it to carry so long a loon.” So the robber
bound his wound and that not without skill or
tenderness. Then did Feargus mutter faintly
in his own tongue, “Thanks to thee for I see thou
art a man, whatever company it be that thou
art in.”</p>

<p>They went on down into the glen, but Feargus
was too faint to mark the way, his head swam
and he had no sense left, but there was before
him a vision of Torfrida seated on the moor
midst a handful of pine trees, with the beasts
lying near, for he never doubted that the white
horse would find his way back to her, and she
waiting vainly for his return. The robbers led
him westwards, down the glen, and there among
the rocks they entered a large cavern, the mouth
of which could not be seen from any distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
outside. The place was filled with peat-reek
from a great fire, and at the further end they
led him into a smaller cave, one of the men showing
the way with a lighted faggot. Dark and
cold and damp the place was, and the water
trickled down the walls in sickly streams, but
Feargus recked not but fell down amidst of it on
the floor and slept. In the night he wakened,
feeling stiff and full of pain, weak and an
hungered. He thought again of Torfrida on the
moor, and his heart grew sick. At length one
came to him and brought him food, and said he,
“Our captain bids me tell thee that an thou wilt
join his band thou shalt live, despite the hurt
thou hast give him; but an thou refusest thou
shalt die.”</p>

<p>So Feargus ate and drank and slept, and, there
being no light, he could not tell whether it were
night or day when he awoke, but of a sudden
some one whispered to him in his native tongue—</p>

<p>“Thou art a North Pict by thy speech; I am
of the south, yet are we all of one blood and one
tongue, though whiles, alas! of two ways of
thinking; arise, brother, and pass out, and thou
wilt find thy bow hanging on the wall on the
right hand as thou goest: thou art o’er brave to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
die thus by the hands of the English. A sword
thou wilt find at thy side and the skin of a deer
to cover thy nakedness. I am a robber yet will
I not see my kin robbed.”</p>

<p>“A brother art thou indeed, as thou sayest,
and great thanks I owe thee, though I naught
can give thee to show it, but if ever I win Alban
and thou comest thither, a hearthstone thou
shalt find to thee and shall lack nothing that I
can give thee, as long as thou livest; for I am
son to king Nechtan and my name is Feargus.”</p>

<p>“Then have I heard much of thee and right
glad I am to serve so noble a warrior. Go lest
they awake, it is about the dawn; such courage
as thou hast can do the rest. I will meet thee
yet in thy father’s hall and be thy man, for
never can I stay in my own country more for an
evil man have I been.”</p>

<p>“Thy name?”</p>

<p>“Domnhull MacEachran MacGilliosa.”</p>

<p>Then Feargus crept out stealthily and took
the bow and the sword, wrapping the deer skins
around him. There he saw the robbers lying,
and he counted them in the dim light of the dying
fire and passed on thinking they were all, when, as
he neared the entrance, he stumbled over a man’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
body. The man started up, sword in hand, and
Feargus felt that he was over weak to do battle
with him, so quickly stabbed him ere he had fully
risen, that he fell back dead. Then he heard the
others bestirring within, roused by the noise, and
he fled; but he knew by the sounds that the
whole cave was now astir. Little knowing the
glen he sped slowly, and those behind were gaining
upon him; so stiff was his left shoulder that
he could not use his bow, and when he reached
the top of the steep side of the glen he was
breathless and faint, but staggered on across the
moor. Then came the robbers on behind him in
full chase, and he felt that he was lost, when lo!
from out a small planting or spinney on his right
a creature ran with a joyous neigh, and ere he
could gather his senses he was nosed all over
head and face by his own great horse. The
beast seemed so overjoyed that Feargus well-nigh
wept over him, being weak. Then he
scrambled to the creature’s back and, patting its
neck, left it to go which way it listed, for he
himself knew not the road back to Torfrida. And
his foes saw a great grey horse run from among
the trees and then their quarry mounted it and
the two were spirited away like shadows of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
gloaming. The horse took its way without
hesitance across the moor, and soon came to the
spot where was Torfrida. And she was overjoyed
at the sight of them and kissed first
Feargus and then the beast. But Feargus himself
was so weak that he nearly fell as he dismounted,
and Torfrida dressed his wound and
gave him water and what food she had remaining,
and she sat awake all that night watching
him. In the morning she found him still too
weak to move, and they dreaded lest the robbers
should find them. So when he was for rising to
seek food Torfrida bade him lie still, and went
and set a trap as he directed her, and they waited
until they caught a bird which she cooked in the
peat ash, and they fared well. So each night
Torfrida watched and slept in the day, and they
stayed in the wood for a week.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW THEY FARED IN THE WILD COUNTRY</span></h2>

<p>After that time, by reason of his great strength
and the cleanness of his blood, the wound was
well-nigh healed. So Feargus took his bow and
went forth and brought food in great plenty, and
they mounted their beasts, which were eager to
be away, and rode down across the moor until
they won the burn by which the robbers dwelt.
Feargus knew it not again, for he had been too
weak to mark the way, but as they reached the
glen he noticed his beast to tremble and he told
Torfrida and hurried her over the stream, bidding
her ride forward a good space, and then lie down
among the heather, for danger was near. “And
much I wish I had my byrny and my great
sword,” said he. Then for fear aught should
befall the beast he rode, he dismounted and
made the creature lie down, and took his bow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
went back towards the ford. There he crouched
down and waited; for he thought that if the
robbers were on their track it would be better to
meet them as they reached the ford than allow
them to cross, but he sighed again for his great
sword and his byrny of rare workmanship.
Then as he lay he became aware of a man clad in
russet hiding among the stones, and he knew
they had been seen. He watched the man till
he arose and ran down towards the foot of the
glen, and presently returned with five men, leading
horses. Among them was he who had
dressed his wound whom he took to be the Pict.
When he saw them his wrath was great for all
the ill they had done him, and belike many more,
and for so little pity they had shown or soldiership.
Then said he, “Little me liketh bloodshed,
but these shall die ere they win the north
side of the burn; for further hurt will they else
do to many.” Then, moreover, he bethought
him of his armour and knew not how he could
win through all that lay before him without it;
so he looked again at his enemies and there
were five of them, less the Pict, who would
not be willing to fight against him. “I have
before now set as many on their backs by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
help of wit and these arrows, and, moreover,
the burn is between us and they will have no
shelter.”</p>

<p>Now they had almost won the ford and Feargus
put an arrow to his bow, and as the first man
entered the water to cross he raised to his knee
and sent the arrow forth. In the act he felt his
wound and it angered him; the man fell back
into the water with the arrow sticking in him a
foot deep, and neither shout nor groan gave he,
for Feargus was a merciful death-dealer. The
captain, seeing his man swept away in the flood,
cried “On.” Then Feargus, that he might
know who was before him, stood upright; but
the captain knew well, forsooth, and halted
them before they touched the water, to shoot
their arrows. Feargus lay down in the heather
to avoid them, but they having the water before
them were without shelter, so again he drew his
bow, and another leapt forward and fell headlong
into the stream, to be quickly followed by a
third. There only remained the Pict and the
captain, who turned to flee. Then Feargus
shouted out, “Now, sir captain, an ye turn, ye
shall die, ere ye have fled fifty paces, an ye stand
ye shall fight hand to hand with me, for where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
odds are equal I will take no vantage of bow or
arrow, though I be without byrny. I have left
thee till the last for thou didst in cowardly wise
strike me when wounded, and I would that thou
shouldst see the ruin of thy men and thyself.”
Then Feargus moved forward, and the captain
turned to the Pict, saying, “Why standest thou
and slay him not?”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir captain, I have wrought much evil
since thou didst take me and force me to join
thy band, but never did I yet take hand with a
stranger like thee against mine own kin. A
king’s son at least is this, and though I will take
no part against thee neither will I help thee; ye
are man to man and thine enemy is without
byrny, so ye may fight it out.” Then he held
out his sword to Feargus, who straightway
gave it back again, saying, “Nay, keep it,
kinsman.”</p>

<p>Then the captain, seeing there was nothing left
but to fight, drew, and Feargus drew also his
sword, but it was not his own blade; fiercely
they fell to and the robber wrought with great
might till Feargus drew back a pace and dealt a
great blow, and the blade shore the robber’s
helm clean through the side, leaving the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
unharmed, but breaking itself nigh to the hilt,
and the robber staggered from left to right as
one drunk. Then Feargus was without arms,
but, keeping still the broken hilt of the sword in
his hand, he dashed at his antagonist, striking
him full in the face; then wresting the sword
from his hand, flung it across the burn and,
lifting the robber, gripped him so hard that he
cried out; then, running a few paces, hurled him
into the flood nigh to where it took a mighty leap
of many feet amid jagged rocks: and so no
creature save the raven saw him thereafter.
Feargus turned back to where the Pict stood
awe-stricken at so fierce a fight, and he took
his bow and bade him lead to the cave. Lightly
he obeyed, and they entered, and there Feargus
found his byrny and his great sword of wondrous
temper and all that he had lost. Then the Pict
told him they must get away lest the rest of the
band should return from the neighbouring dales
and find their captain slain. “And I will take
what will serve me and fly, for they will not
believe my story, and I will away into Galloway
privily and find my kin and then will I come
north to serve thee all my days, for the greatest
of warriors art thou. Thou wilt find difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
enough in fending for thyself and thy young
friend else would I join thee.”</p>

<p>So the Pict went one way and Feargus went
another, and stripping off the skins with which
he was clad he sprang into the stream and swam
about, for his wound’s sake. Then being refreshed,
he gained the land and dressed him and
donned his byrny, over it casting the skins to
hide the brightness of it and called his horse,
which arose quickly and followed him. When
Torfrida saw that he had his sword again and his
byrny she was rejoiced greatly. So they rode
on across the moor and they could see nothing
save heather and whin and bracken, with clumps
of trees far apart, and patches of bog covered
with long grass, and the wild myrtle that sent
forth a sweet smell, and in the distance hills and
glens innumerable. So they journeyed for many
days. But ever the nights drew out and the
days drew in, and Feargus had much ado to find
food or a dry spot to cast their tent in, and the
cold strengthened and much rain fell and sometimes
hail and snow. And they were often
forced to spend whole days in resting and waiting
for the storms to abate. And sometimes they
lost their road among the fells. They stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
now on the bare hill side where nothing but the
cry of the paitrick or the plover was to be heard
the year through; now in wild glens; by crag
and loch and burn ever northward wending.
Soon they found the winter sore upon them, and
the snow lay thick and covered all the land, and
the horses had nothing wherewith to satisfy
their hunger. In the darkness came wild beasts,
and they had to build a great fire each night
around them to scare the creatures. And whiles
they drew right up to it scenting the horses and
then drew back, and at length so bold they grew
that one night two giant wolves leapt across the
flames nigh to where Feargus sat, sword in hand,
but hardly had they reached the earth ere he
plunged his sword down the open jaws of one and
kicked the other backwards into the fire with his
foot. And the snow became so deep that Feargus
built a snow house each night for Torfrida, and
himself stood by the watch-fire outside. And
so they sped, the hazel nut and red deer their
food, or whatever his bow could bring down; and
from all dangers he shielded her, or labour or
weariness or cold, so far as he might in so terrible
a clime. But often his heart failed him and he
felt that death lay before them. At length the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
horses waxed weak for lack of food, and he cut
the meat from the beasts he slew for them, but
he saw that an he could not soon win a clachan
or farmstead they must die.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;" id="illus6">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="480" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The feet of Feargus sank deep in the snow at every step, and made
him weary, but he fared on.</p>
</div>

<p>Their way still lay among the mountains and
little food could they there find, so one evening
Feargus started out in quest thereof and his feet
sank deep in the snow at every step and made
him weary, but he fared on. At last he turned,
thinking to travel back by his footprints, but of
a sudden the sky had grown overcast, and a gust
of wind soughed up the glen and in a moment it
was as though a mist had fallen upon him, for
he could see neither behind nor before, nor sky
nor land, so small and close fell the snow. On
he stumbled trying now to guess the way back
and crying out at intervals, “Torfrida! Torfrida!”
Then he stooped down to seek the footprints,
but found that all were filled with the
driving snow; still he went on hour after hour
and like to drop for weariness, and ever and anon
crying “Torfrida!”</p>

<p>And Torfrida lay awaiting him in her house
builded of snow on the top of a steep hill; for
they feared to stay in the glens at that time lest
the snow-drifts should bury them. As the darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
closed in she set a light to her fire. Then,
of a sudden, the storm burst upon them and had
it not been that their place of halting was cunningly
chosen in a spot sheltered from the winds
common in that quarter, her fire would have been
quenched altogether. The darkness thickened
and fear fell upon her for her lover, and she stood
in the doorway watching over the plain below.
It might be about midnight when far away
across the fells in front of her she thought she
heard the cry “Torfrida!” She fancied it foreboded
his death, and wished herself dead, for
their troubles seemed like to overwhelm them.
All night the tempest raged, and all the day
following, and still she fed the fire, till her heap
of faggots grew low, for she knew that it would
be his only guide, if guide he longer needed. On
the night of the second day she again thought
she heard that weird cry “Torfrida!” and arose
and shrieked “Feargus! Feargus!” Then she
fancied she saw a great white form staggering
about far down on the moor beneath, till at
length it fell or seemed to, then slowly and with
little life arose once more; then she tried to go
out to it, but was too weak and full of horror, for
a creature of another world this might be and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
swooned, and as she awoke suddenly a giant
form rose up before her deep covered with snow
frozen to it from beard to foot, and with one
wild cry, “Torfrida!” it staggered forward and
fell headlong at her feet, and she knew that he
had come.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW THEY FELL AMONG FOES</span></h2>

<p>So they stayed there on the hillside for a week
and then arose and went forward, but with heavy
hearts and weary feet, leaving behind them
Torfrida’s palfrey, which had died for very
weariness; and the two wept as they went forth
once more across the wilderness. At length
they drew near to a broad burn which they
crossed, and, faring on, soon beheld a town to the
left of them and knew not in what country they
were, but feared they had come too far to the
east and had entered Northumbria. They
pressed on till they drew nigh to the town and
anon met men coming forth of it, but these
stared aghast at sight of them and fled, so wild
were their looks and so lean and haggard their
faces. At length they came to a herdsman’s
shieling high up on the hills, and Torfrida went
in and found the herd with his wife sitting by
the ingle. When the wife beheld her she let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
forth a scream; then said Torfrida, “Nay, good
people, have no fear, for I am a woman of thine
own country and an hungered, yet gold have we
to pay thee for such shelter as thou canst give.”</p>

<p>“The lady is beautiful and looks good—she is
welcome to all we have.”</p>

<p>“Nay, but I ask the boon also for my lover
who is without, but so great of stature is he and
so wild are his looks from much travail that we
twain have come through, that methought he
might fear thee.”</p>

<p>“Yea let him enter also.”</p>

<p>Then Feargus entered and sat him down, and
the people were Northumbrians, and when the
good wife saw him she said, “Now thou art a
man indeed!” So they fared well in that house
for three weeks, and Feargus waxed strong again,
as did Torfrida, and light of heart, for it seemed
as though their troubles were ended, since here
they did not know him for Feargus. At length
they minded them of their journey, and Feargus
brought forth his beast that looked well and
stout as of old, and rejoiced his master’s heart.
Their host then found a good beast for Torfrida,
and they rode out and sought to escape the town,
but they had hardly won clear of it ere a party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of soldiers met them and hailed Feargus and
questioned him and, judging him to be a
foreigner, took him before the king, who knew
him for Feargus. Then were they cast each into
a dungeon, while a messenger was sent to king
Sigmund and Osbert, the king’s friends, telling
of their capture. Now none had seen that under
his rags Feargus wore a byrny, and his jailors,
being half afraid of him owing to the tales of his
strength and fierceness, which were common
among the Northumbrian soldiery, had left him
his sword and bow. They lay in the prison for a
week, and the dungeon of Feargus was such that
he could not hold himself upright therein, and
the walls were dank with water. He looked
about for means of escape, and soon knew by
slight sounds that there was a person in the cell
next him and so he knocked on the wall, thinking
it might be Torfrida, and at once heard an
answering knock. Then, his heart beating fast
for gladness, he set about digging at the wall
with his sword, and dug with great labour all the
night, and by morning had wrought so well that
one of the stones was loosened and he lifted it
out and they spoke together. Then said she,
“See how the Northumbrians treat a king’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
daughter,” and he saw that there were chains
about her, but dreading that he might brain
him, the jailor had left the manacling of his male
prisoner until such times as he might be weak
from lack of food.</p>

<p>Feargus worked for two nights and days until
he had removed another stone, and could creep
through the opening. He then set to work to
cut away the stone which held the bolt in the
door of Torfrida’s cell, taking the stones of the
wall by which he entered in and out each day,
and returning to his own cell at the hour at
which the jailor brought his prisoners’ food, for
he came first to Torfrida’s cell. Then he told
Torfrida to hold herself in readiness, and at
length one night lay down before the door of
his dungeon, so that when the man came in he
fell over him, and Feargus sprang upon him and
stunned him, then tearing his jerkin into shreds,
twisted them into a rope and bound him with
it that he might not rouse the men who stood on
guard. He then bade Torfrida to follow, and
forth they sped in the cool night wind towards
the water, and no man stopped them. So they
won the sea and walked along the coast towards
where the shipping lay. There they found many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
small boats lying, and entered into one of them,
and, fearing to linger, put out to sea. In her
they found water and a little meat, but she was
open to the seas. They rowed till they were
out of sight of land and then turned northwards
by the stars. They kept out at sea so
that in the day they could just make out the
distant shore.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus7">
<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="700" height="480" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Then Feargus thought that Torfrida was like to die, for she fainted,
and lay for long as one in death.</p>
</div>

<p>On the second day the wind blew cold and
Torfrida was sore distressed, and in the night it
arose to a tempest and they were tossed about
for many hours, the boat flying before the wind
so that they had no mastery over her. When
the day dawned they found that they had been
driven out to sea and had lost sight of the coast,
and they were mightily afraid thereat. At
length on the fourth day the sea grew calm and
the wind fell. Then Feargus took to his oars,
but no sight of land could he get, and he steered
him as he best might. They had little meat to
eat the while, or water to drink, for their store
had been but scant at the beginning. He rowed
ever on till weariness fell upon him, and still he
rowed, and daily saw Torfrida dwining before
his eyes. His heart smote him, for was it not by
his own doing that so great trouble had fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
upon her? Soon they had neither bite nor sup
left, and the cold winds cut them to the quick.
Then Feargus thought that Torfrida was like to
die, for she fainted, and lay for long as one in
death. There came to him the thought of slaying
himself; he waited long but at last she awoke,
and he drew his sword and cut his arm and
poured the blood down her throat till she revived.
Then he bound up his arm that she might not
know wherewith he had fed her. Once more he
took the oars, though full faint himself, and sped
on, but hope was dead in him and he listed not
whither he went. And all through the night the
cold stars look down upon the little boat bearing
the gaunt man, who seemed like to one in a
dream, who nor feeling nor sense hath of earthly
things, yet ever plyeth his oars monotonously.
His eyes were glassy, and fixed ever on the
white-faced woman who lay at his feet with the
marks of death already upon her. And neither
he nor she spake, nor had done for many days.
As the night wore through the big man ceased to
move to and fro, and drawing with a last effort
his oars from the water, fell backward into the
bottom of the boat. So, until the sun was high
in the lift. Then he started up but knew not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
where he was nor what thing had befallen him,
but only saw that not a bowshot from him was
a line of grey cliff, mist-haunted, bird-inhabited,
and washed by mighty waters whose thunder
echoed continually along the crags. Then did
he know himself and staggered up and shouted,
“Land, land!” And dimly through the mist of
her half-consciousness Torfrida knew that they
were saved.</p>

<p>Then Feargus roused him and drew forth the
oars and steered their way among the rocks and
green waters now still and sleepful that had been
so fierce. Here they had made a small bay,
there a creek; into one of these he steered the
boat up against the rocks, whence he saw the
birds fly forth, and at length in a cranny he saw
some eggs lying. These he seized and broke and
poured between the lips of Torfrida and then of
himself. In the creek he found a ledge of rock
above high water, and rowed his boat to it and
fastened her and there lay down and slept for an
hour. Then he arose and, being too weak to use
his bow, found more eggs and fed Torfrida with
them. Then he landed by scrambling on to the
shelf of rock, and, seeking about, found pools of
rain water and drank and gave likewise to Torfrida.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
The next day found him refreshed so
that he was able to lift her on to the shelf and
himself rowed out a little way in search of eggs,
which he found among the crags in great plenty.
So they stayed there many days, living in a cave
and wandering among the rocks like the sea
birds themselves, their daily food the eggs of
the seamew and cormorant. And the place
was always dark, lying like a watery ravine
between the crags, so that the sun never shone
there; but their hearts lay deep too between the
sorrows that encompassed them and they missed
him not. At length their strength was renewed,
but they were still fearful of going forth once
more on a journey so terrible. And when they
left their watery home they sighed, for days of
peace had they known there, who had forgotten
what peace was; and the cry of the seamew, the
floating mists, and the boom of breaking waters
had become dear to them, while the very birds
knew them and feared them not.</p>

<p>And so, at length, they stepped into their boat
and rowed through the creek out into the sunlight,
and the sight of it gladdened them. They
kept along the cliffs that day and in the evening
ran up one of the narrow creeks and waited till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the morn. After many miles the cliffs ceased
and an open coast took their place, then Feargus
thought to land and find out what country they
were in; so they made the shore, and right glad
was Feargus to find they were in the land of
Lothian, not knowing they had won so far
north. In those days the Kelts of the
Lothians were groaning under the rule of the
Northumbrians, whose language they came afterwards
to speak, though they still kept their
nationality and their patriotism, even if they
grew in some measure away from their Gaelic
kindred of the north and west. So at length
after sailing up a broad river, wanting food
and water, they saw a great town lying low
down towards the water’s edge, and Feargus
landed, and they approached the town, which
they found to be the ancient Roman city of
Camelon on Forth, that stood hard by the
Roman wall. After walking some way they
were noticed by the people and surrounded by a
band of warriors of the chief who was set over
Lothian and called himself king. They were
hurried through splendid gates of brass to the
town, the people coming out of their houses
to look at them, and were brought before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
king, who was a Northumbrian and had much
wealth and many foreign warriors in his pay.
Now his thane had bethought him that the sight
of folk so rude as looked these twain would
pleasure his master. The king, who had an eye
for fighting men, saw in Feargus the shape of a
warrior, and knew by the way he strode and held
himself that he was a practised and strong man
of his hands, and was well pleased to have such
brought to him, thinking to win him to his
service. If the master knew a warrior though
ill clad, his men did not, but thought him little
better than a savage or a slave. Feargus knew
well by their tongue that they were English and
ruling a people who were near kin to his own and
he was wroth to see it, and being full of strength
from his life on the cliffs, and seeing Torfrida’s
face smooth and shining with health, he was
little in the humour to brook insult offered. So
it chanced as the king stood questioning him
that one of his nobles turned to Torfrida and
laid rough hands upon her, saying, “Come
hither, lad, let me see thee; thou lookest like a
wench,” and so drew aside the ragged covering
which hid her face. When the people saw her
beauty they were amazed thereat, but not long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
gazed the earl upon her, for his hand was hardly
off her snood ere Feargus, seizing his sword,
clove him through the helm, nigh killing him,
and crying in English, “Manners, thou dog!”</p>

<p>The earl’s men turned to flee for very horror of
the thing they saw, till their captain rallied
them, and, crying out for vengeance, rushed upon
Feargus. Then the king, who was just and
dearly loved a bold act, was mightily taken with
his new soldier, and he roared in a voice of
thunder, “Stand; let no man stir, I will deal.”
Turning to Feargus, he said, “Now, beggar or
warrior, for such I see thou art, what sayest thou
for thyself? Thou hast nigh slain an earl of my
court.”</p>

<p>“That were a mishap indeed, sir king; but I
hold that when I struck him his acts were such
that no man, being a stranger, could tell him for
an earl, for I have seen beggars and billmen with
better manners; therefore am I not to blame
more than if I had slain a worse beggar than
myself.”</p>

<p>“Humph! thou art an outspoken beggar, in
sooth, but I tell thee thou shalt go unharmed an
thou wilt enter my bodyguard, for they lack a
captain at this present, and I see thou art such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
man of thy hands that I wot of none that could
captain them like thee.”</p>

<p>Now Feargus saw that the bluff king was a man
after his own heart, good humoured yet resolute
and strong, and he knew well that his only chance
was to enter his new friend’s service, so he said—</p>

<p>“I will do as thou dost wish, king, since thou
hast so befriended us, and I will serve thee
well and faithfully for so long as my lady and
myself go unmolested,” and he put his two
hands between those of the king as the English
custom was.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW TORFRIDA WAS STOLEN</span></h2>

<p>So they stayed some months at the court of
Lothian, and Torfrida had a house set apart for
her and maids to wait and do her bidding and
had full liberty to walk about freely, but she saw
little of Feargus, for he was much away on the
king’s business. And Feargus knew not how
they might get away from these parts, and
wondered much how it fared with Edwy and
Sigmund.</p>

<p>And one evening it chanced that Torfrida was
walking late in her garden when of a sudden
from the hedgerows on either side burst armed
men with their faces masked. Torfrida, being
surprised, stood still for a moment, when she
was seized from behind and a cloth cast about
her, then strong hands lifted her and she was
borne away till they came to where seemed to
be horses waiting. She was then taken up and
borne on the saddle before the rider, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
rode for many miles over much uneven ground.
She could hear that on either side and behind
her were horsemen. At length they drew up,
then Torfrida heard the noise of a drawbridge
and the tramp of the hoofs of the beasts as they
rode across; then it was drawn up behind them
and at the sound the heart fell within her. They
carried her into the castle, for such she deemed
it wherein she was. The cloth was now withdrawn
from her head and she saw that she was
in a large chamber, handsomely furnished and
hung around with rich tapestry, and with her
was a stout woman in the dress of a servant.</p>

<p>“Oh, where am I, why have they brought me
here?” said she.</p>

<p>“Thou art safe, lady; they have brought thee
here because my master, the prince, has loved
thee since the day they took thee to the king
with yon great man thy squire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell me who is thy master? I know him
not.”</p>

<p>“Weep not, lady; my master is right comely.”</p>

<p>“What is his comeliness to me?”</p>

<p>“Nay, thou hast seen him, but thou wouldst
not look upon him, so he was angered, and he
knew that his father, the king, set too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
store by thy knight to let him take thee from
him, even if he had a wish to fight thy lord,
which methinketh few men about the king have.
So he cast round for a way to win thee, and none
other could he think of but the taking of thee in
this wise—but there, I am telling thee too much.
It matters little, for I am sent, my lady, to tell
thee that my master, prince Siegfried, wills to
wed thee to-night—for he fears to lose thee still;
even now the priest awaits thy coming, and the
feast is spread.”</p>

<p>Torfrida groaned aloud.</p>

<p>“As thou art a woman I beg thee to let me
hence. Let me go out into the mountains and
the woods that the wild beasts may devour me.”</p>

<p>“Nay, thou art over young and comely, and
I would not if I could, for it would be shame.”</p>

<p>“Nay, good woman, not shame as great as
mine will be when this wild beast thou speakest
of, thy master, comes. Let me hence and
amongst the hills and moors I may find men who
speak the Gaelic tongue and will befriend me.”</p>

<p>“Nay, thou art in the hills here and all the
men about Glencorse and Bonaly are adread of
the prince and this new castle, and thou wouldst
lose thyself and be drowned in the bogs that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
surround us long before any of the Pictland men
could succour thee, for hills encompass Glencorse
on every side and the paths are hard to
find to a stranger. And they would quickly
follow thee with dogs and men and there would
be no escape.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say not so, good woman, for I could slay
myself by leaping into the burn or into the bog—it
were easy.”</p>

<p>“Nay, vex not thyself, child. Thou wilt soon
be reconciled. And if I let thee free, then
would the prince be so angry that he would turn
me into the night, if he did not slay me, and I am
old and the fireside is my place, and I have
neither kith nor kin to shelter me in this wild
country.”</p>

<p>“Nay, then, if thou fearest for thyself let me
escape on to the battlements and I will throw
myself from them and thy master will never
know thou hast shown me the way, but will
believe I have escaped from thee. And I will
give thee these rings and this collar of gold
worth a king’s ransom, an thou wilt be rich.”
And Torfrida threw herself on the ground and
clasped and kissed the woman’s feet.</p>

<p>“Nay, rise, sweet girl, for I lack courage for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
this thing thou askest. I would serve thee if I
could for never have I seen any woman so modest
and so comely as thou art. Greet no more and
have no fear, for the prince is mad for love of
thee and will let no harm befall thee, but will
wed thee and make thee lady of his house and
the queen of all his lands.”</p>

<p>Now Torfrida saw that she could not move
the woman and she arose and bade her leave her,
and the woman went. Then Torfrida ran round
the room to see whether there were any hope of
escape, but the windows were small and set high
up on the walls, and across them were stout iron
bars. Now she saw that the walls were built of
huge logs of wood and were of great thickness,
and from the windows were hangings of heavy
tapestry. In the wide chimney upon a stone
slab fixed into the earth floor burnt a fire of
wood. Torfrida drew forth a burning faggot
and then stepped to the windows and set the
hangings alight, then she ran to the tapestry on
the walls and did the like. In an instant there
was a roar that frightened her and she screamed;
she could not help it, as a sheet of flame shot up
the walls. Only the inner side remained and
Torfrida, recovering herself, in her frenzy went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
light the wall, though her terror of what she had
done almost overcame her. As she stooped to
apply the faggot the door flew open and a huge
woman with red face and flaunting dress stood
over her, and with a cry of astonishment and
rage struck Torfrida with her open hand upon
the ear with such force that she, being light and
slim of figure, fell upon the ground. She lay for
a moment and then arose, but as she gained her
feet the woman struck her again on the other
side of the head so that she fell down again upon
her knees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;" id="illus8">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="480" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Torfrida drew forth a burning faggot, and then stepped to the windows
and set the hangings alight.</p>
</div>

<p>“Huzzy!” she screamed, “who are you that
would burn us in our beds?” and then she walked
to the door and cried “Fire!” and in a moment
men came running with vessels filled with water,
and they tore the hangings down and in ten
minutes, so well they wrought, that they had
quenched all the flames.</p>

<p>Then Torfrida, dizzy and sick with the blows
she had received, stole out of the door unnoticed
in the smoke and confusion, and turned along the
corridor, thinking to throw herself from the
battlements. She passed swiftly along a maze of
narrow passages till she found a stair; up this
she ran and presently felt a breath of wind, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
turned to face it thinking it might come from
the battlements. She sped along, staggering
much from the blows she had received, till she
saw a door and pushed it open and, lo! she found
herself in a large hall and before her stood the
big red-faced stout woman who had struck her.
Torfrida screamed and begged for mercy.</p>

<p>“Ha, huzzy! thou wert thinking to escape.
My son wed thee, forsooth! Thou imp of evil!
thou witch! Wouldst burn us in our beds! I
will teach thee better manners,” and she seized
her by the wrist with one hand and beat her with
the other till the blood flowed from her nose and
mouth and she sank down in a swoon. Then
the woman got water and threw it over her and
picked her up like an infant, and taking her into
another room laid her upon a bed and left her,
locking the door as she went. And presently
the old tire-woman came in and when she saw
her she wept. “Then she hath beaten thee,
poor child. No wonder the king cannot live
with so great a brute!” And she washed the
blood from Torfrida’s nose and mouth and kissed
her and put cold bandages round her head.
“Ah, thou wert foolish not to give way as I told
thee and wed the prince without ado, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
will defend thee from her, and I will wait upon
thee and love thee, for I have nothing else to
love.”</p>

<p>Knowing she could not move her, Torfrida
thanked the woman and bid her go and return in
an hour, and she said, “I charge ye, good woman,
tell no one of the usage I have received at this
dame’s hands, for it puts shame upon me.”</p>

<p>In an hour the wife returned and found Torfrida
calm and white and bland, with a smile
upon her face, and her manner was decided and
she no longer craved for help.</p>

<p>“Go, good wife,” she said, “and tell the
prince, thy master, that an he loves me he must
leave me to-night. I am ill and sore and weary
with the rough handling and rough riding, for
tell him women have not the strength of men;
but I know thy master is a soldier and brave,
they say, and would not needlessly distress a
maiden even if he loved her not. Now I charge
you, my woman, speak him fair as I speak,”
added she, “for an thou dost not thou shalt be
no woman of mine when I am queen of thy
master’s hearth.”</p>

<p>“Now thou speakest, my lady, and I will do
thy bidding, as I would be thy tire-woman, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
well I know thou art a great lady and a king’s
daughter.”</p>

<p>Then she went below and entered the hall
where sat the prince at the board, fierce, impatient,
and flushed. At his side were his companions,
wild, loose sots, half soldiers, half forest
robbers. Among them were many of the native
Britons of Lothian of the race of Gwynedd, who
had entered the service of the conqueror that
they might keep their lands, even though below
them was a sturdy race of clansmen full of the
spirit of nationality and true to the nation of
the Southern Albanich or Picts to which their
land of Gododin had been joined, and friendly
also to the stronger nation of the Northern Picts.
These men, deserted by their natural chiefs, were
waiting only for the leadership of a few strong
men to take up arms against the Anglian settlers.
In the Pentland and Muirfoot hills, and indeed
in all the hill country, the Britons and Picts had
been able to hold their own. At the prince’s
board were also one or two soldiers of fortune or
outlaws of the nation of the South Picts and
the rest Northumbrians, Mercians, Lindeseymen,
and men from other quarters, a motley throng.
At the side of the prince stood a priest of unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
feature and shifty eye. At the other
end of the table opposite the prince was a vacant
chair, richly embroidered and draped with
crimson and cloth of gold; to right and left of
this sat the ladies of the chiefs. When he saw
that the tire-woman had not Torfrida with her,
the prince looked angry, but when she delivered
her message his wrath was mollified for, be it
said, he had great fear of his father’s captain
and of his father, who loved only the fair fight,
and within him was a foreboding of evil; but if
the lady were going to prove willing what could
her lover or the king have to complain of if they
married? He could then spread it abroad that
the lady had fled with him to escape from her
squire. And was it not easy to believe that she
should choose him instead of a beggarly captain!
And so he smiled and sent back a message to her
that she must be of good cheer, for nothing
should she lack that gold might buy. So the
wife returned and Torfrida retired to her bedchamber
and tried to sleep. In the morning
the woman entered.</p>

<p>“How doth my lady this morning?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I am weary and will not rise to-day.”</p>

<p>“But the prince, my lady?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“What of the prince?”</p>

<p>“He wishes at least to see thee and has been
walking the hall the night through so distracted
is he for love of thee.”</p>

<p>“Tell him I am sick.”</p>

<p>So they let her alone that day, but the next
the woman came again. “My lady, the prince
hath been pacing the walls all the night, and he
saith he dieth for love of thee, and I would
counsel thee, if thou wilt take my rede, not to
delay; for like a madman he goeth between love
and fear. Hark ye, he is even now without.”</p>

<p>“Then dress me and help me to the couch in
the outer chamber and I will speak with him.”</p>

<p>So she laid her on the couch and the prince
entered, and when he saw her, how pale she was
after her terrible beating and long fast, he was
abashed and came and knelt down by her. Then
Torfrida put out her hand and he kissed it.</p>

<p>“What manner of prince or knight art thou
that presseth thy suit even though the lady lie
sick unto death? Is this the way of princes?”</p>

<p>Now the prince was young, if old in riotous
living, and the sight of a noble and beautiful
maiden had not lost its hold upon him, even
though his fears for his own safety filled him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>He answered not, and Torfrida knew that she
had shamed him.</p>

<p>“Have I not sent word that I would see thee
when I am cured of this sickness? Better
treatment would I receive at the hands of a
common man. If thou lovest me let me be till
I am whole.”</p>

<p>“If I might but kiss thy lips I will rest me
content, sweet lady, till thou art healed.”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt act as a prince only an thou mayest
kiss me. Thou wouldst kiss when thou hast not
wooed me; surely thou hast a way of wooing of
thine own.”</p>

<p>“Say no more, I will leave thee, but keep me
not long, I implore thee.”</p>

<p>“Here, thou mayest kiss my hand an thou art
so minded. Now, get thee gone.”</p>

<p>Then the prince returned and no sooner had
he reached the hall than he stamped and swore
in rage, and called himself fool and faint of
heart; for he had been overcome by a woman,
though he had sworn to his followers that he
would wed Torfrida that day, sick or well. So
he was much haunted by fears and doubts, and
knew no rest either day or night. Two days
later he went again to Torfrida’s chamber door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and knocked. Then Torfrida took from her
finger a ring which held a rare stone of wondrous
lustre, and she gave it to the tire-woman, who
took it to the prince, telling him that Torfrida
saw that he was indeed a gentle prince and
knight. So the prince went down to the hall
again and the barons laughed at him and nodded
to each other, saying that the woman was too
clever for him. The prince was angry and drank
deep, and the waiting-woman told Torfrida what
they were saying in the hall.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE CASTLE IN THE PENTLANDS</span></h2>

<p>Now the prince had been absent from his father’s
hall for many days and feared his anger or that
suspicion might fall upon him; so that night he
took his horse and rode into the city of Camelon
and entered his father’s hall. There he found
Feargus talking with the king. When the prince
entered, Feargus turned to withdraw and, in a
moment, beheld the wondrous ring on the prince’s
finger; then his heart leapt for very joy, for in
dire trouble had he been. So he went out and
donned his byrny and slung his great sword over
his shoulder, and then, covering it all with the
habit of a wandering minstrel, took his harp,
the clarsach, or small harp of the Gael, and made
himself a beard of great length and whiteness so
that, having donned it, none could know him.
He then went forth, mounted on a sorry nag,
which laboured so under his weight that he had
pity on it and sighed for his great grey horse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
He rode to the outskirts of the town and there
waited the prince’s coming. Long after midnight
he approached with a strong company of warriors,
and Feargus dismounted and sat upon a fallen
tree, and as the prince drew nigh played a plaintive
tune. With the clarsach and pipe the
Picts excelled, and of them few could be likened
to Feargus for skill. Now the prince was filled
with thoughts of love, yet was he angry at
having been so thwarted, and fearful also for his
own life. So when he heard the harp in the still
night he turned to the harper and drew in his
beast, whereupon Feargus sang this song:—</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The prince listened till the end of the song,
and said he, “Thou hast wondrous skill, good
minstrel; never heard I the like, nay, and the
song thou singest pleaseth me.”</p>

<p>Then Feargus answered, imitating the broken
English of the Lothian Britons, “Yes, sir knight,
but I am old and my hand will not long keep its
cunning.”</p>

<p>“Here’s gold to thee, and, if thou art willing,
thou mayest come with me this night, for there
is much merriment in my hall and I am to wed a
fair lady to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“That will I gladly, sir knight, but my beast
is old and weary and can go but slowly.”</p>

<p>“An thou canst play as thou wert doing a
minute since I will wait on thy beast and ride
with thee.”</p>

<p>Then Feargus arose, but made as though he
were bent and decrepit, and, mounting his beast,
rode on behind the prince; but they went but
slowly for the horse of Feargus was overdone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and Feargus was a merciful man and loved all
breathing things. At length they won the castle,
and Feargus marked it well. It lay between
high hills in a narrow glen, and to the west were
two hills with conical tops;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> it was a great building
of wood, stone, and earth and had many
towers, some tall and narrow and pointed, others
in the style of the Roman city of Camelon, which
could be seen lying in the plain to the north-west,
from the great brae up which they wended
by the hill of Bonaly. Close by the castle
stretched a loch and the hills encompassed it.
It was the last outpost of the English of Lothian
built to keep back the native people who still
held out in the wide moors and fastnesses. They
entered over the drawbridge and the prince bade
his servants give the minstrel meat and drink
and then bring him to the hall. They set the
meat before him and he ate heartily, so that they
were astonished he being so old a man. Then
said the seneschal, “Methinks thou hast had a
mighty frame in thy youth, good minstrel.”
“Aye, and thou hast handled a sword as well as
a harp methinks, father,” said another.</p>

<p>Then Feargus arose. “Yes,” he said, “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
have used the harp and the sword, but better I
love the harp which makes men merry than the
sword which makes them sad.”</p>

<p>“Thou sayest sooth,” said the seneschal, and
Feargus took his harp and soon, such was his
skill, and such was the beauty of the music of
Albainn which he played, that they forgot the
harper and cried, “Well done! well done! thou
art the king of minstrels.”</p>

<p>They took him to the hall and there, as he
entered, he beheld the prince seated at the
middle of the table and at his right hand and
his left a great and motley company of wild
and savage men, on the faces of most of whom
drunkenness had left its mark. The prince
himself was a man of bloated visage, but well
featured and powerful of form and with an air
of some courtliness. He was, moreover, much
younger than most of his companions. At his
right hand sat Torfrida dressed in red and cloth
of gold, a jewel of wondrous beauty in her hair.
Feargus thought her pale at first, but so lively
and bright was she, and so merrily she chatted
with the prince, that he was surprised. Instead
of finding her distressed he found her gay, and
so far from being appalled by the thought of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
marriage with the prince on the coming day, she
was bright and lively. Feargus looked again—this
was no feigned composure or merriment.
Had she forgotten him, and, glad to escape the
dangers of their journey, was she going to wed
the prince? The thought flashed across his
brain only to be crushed back, and he was
ashamed that it had even entered his heart. A
merry peal of laughter rang through the hall and
thrilled him, and the thought returned again,
again to be forced back. Then he struck his
harp, avoiding all those airs which Torfrida
knew, and so, the meal over, Torfrida sped
lightly through the hall to her chamber leaning
on the arm of the prince. Feargus stood up in
the corridor as they passed, for move he could
not, and he watched him bid her farewell at the
door, she giving him her hand to kiss and
waving it to him as he passed along to the hall.
And when the door of her chamber closed on her
Feargus felt his knees give under him; his
strength melted away; his body shook so that
his harp nigh fell from his hands. Anger against
her he felt none but only grief. There life ended
for him; all the pain, the weariness, the danger
he had passed through for her and with her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
returned to him and crushed him. Now he was
in the snowstorm, now in the robbers’ cave, now
he leapt into the waters of Aire after the host of
Penda; now she plucked him by the beard and
awoke him from his madness with her touch—how
beautiful she looked in that moment of
recognition, was ever human creature so lovely
before! Then he saw her dying face upturned
in the boat and cut his arm that she might drink.
Anger—no, he could never feel anger towards
her, and towards him—if she loved him he
should go unscathed, and what help he could
give should be his. Then the water gathered in
his eyes and despair seized him, and he groped
with his hand for his sword to slay himself, and
then he staggered forward a step or two and
sank to earth knowing no more.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE FEAST IN SIEGFRIED’S HALL</span></h2>

<p>Long time he lay, till at length he became ware
of one kneeling beside him, while strong wine
was poured between his teeth; then soft lips
kissed his forehead and a soft voice whispered
in his ear, “Awake, oh, awake! Oh, what aileth
thee, my Feargus? Now thou openest thine
eyes. Thanks be to God! hadst thou died I
would have slain myself—there, drink a little.”
And then she kissed him again and wept and
kissed, between joy and grief. “Canst thou
arise,” she said at length, “for there is danger in
lying here lest any should come. Better sit in
my chamber till thou art well—my tire-woman
is abed.”</p>

<p>So Feargus arose and stepped into the light,
but he no longer dare look at her, but stood
before her shamefaced and cringed on the ground
beneath, kissing her feet and asking forgiveness.</p>

<p>“I know not what it is that I must forgive;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
what hast thou ever done that should need my
forgiveness?”</p>

<p>Then Feargus told her and she went white and
trembled, and wept again, and refused his kisses
and turned from him, till at last she forgave him
and he arose. And she told him all that had
happened since she was taken captive, and how
she had set the tapestry on fire and been beaten by
the earl’s mother and had tried to find the battlements
to fling herself from them, and how she
had gone instead into the hall where her enemy
was and been again sorely beaten. And he was
full of rage and indignation and grief and shame
at his own doubts of one so noble and devoted.</p>

<p>“Then,” said she, “know that I knew thee
the moment thou didst enter despite thy disguise,
for no other harper that ever me saw
doth hold his harp as fondly and strike it just as
thou dost; but even had this not been so, I
should have known thee for Feargus among ten
thousand, and so overjoyed was I at seeing thee
that I could scarce contain myself, for never
did I think the ring would betray him so quickly
and I had little hope indeed. Now thou must
go, and at thy signal I will do as thou hast bidden
me, to-morrow, and I pray we may get hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
with whole skins, but my heart fails me at the
thought.”</p>

<p>“Much have we come through and it will go
hard if we do not escape from this place.”</p>

<p>So he departed to the hall and lay among the
rushes on the floor, where he slept soundly, many
dangers having taught him to sleep when he
might, that his strength should be husbanded.
When the folk began to stir about the castle he
arose, and, breakfasting with the soldiers, waited
in the hall while they got ready a great feast, for
that day the prince was to wed the strange lady
and he and his friends were to make merry. So
the hour of the feast drew nigh and the nobles
entered and took their places at the board on
either side the prince. On the right hand was
Torfrida, dressed in a long white gown, about
which in cunning wise was drawn a sash of gold.
The veil which had half hidden her face yesterday
had gone, and her fair hair with its shining
depths of red and gold fell down over her
shoulders in simple fashion. So lovely she
looked, and so young and fresh and ruddy, that a
murmur arose from the rough soldiers and serving
men as she entered, and even the loose, low
sots who sat round the board gazed upon her for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a moment open-mouthed. And they ceased to
wonder how it was that the strange maiden had
been able to make their master put off the
wedding, day by day. Feargus, who sat among
the servants at the opposite end of the table, had
been playing, but as she entered his hand had
fallen, and he stopped to gaze with the rest.
Seeing this the prince turned and said, “Why
stoppest thou, minstrel? When I bid thee thou
mayest stop.”</p>

<p>Then there entered a few other women, wives
of the nobles, coarse and red-faced like their
lords with much eating and drinking. By
them Torfrida looked the fairer. The feast
began, and thereafter the wine cup went round
and Feargus played his merriest music that they
might drink the more. Soon there was no man
among them that had not taken more than
enough and some grew noisy, and shouts and
oaths filled the hall, while some lay asleeping with
their heads on the board. And so mad was the
music that many drank still, till at length the
prince arose, his face flushed and hand unsteady,
and cried, “A toast with me, my friends; I
pledge the bonniest lady in Lothian!”</p>

<p>“Nay, now, sir prince, how shall they know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
that thy words be true unless thou tellest whose
lady she is that thou dost pledge, for there may
be some here who hold their own ladies the
bonniest.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast over much to say for thyself, sir
minstrel. I tell thee I will break the head of
him who will refuse to drink this toast with me:
the lady I speak of is mine.”</p>

<p>“Nay, then, prince, my head must thou break,
for her I hold to be the fairest lady in this company
is mine.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! what new foolery is this to please
the company? Go on, minstrel, it must be
something of great wit to warrant thy assurance.
Here is an old coxcomb indeed, friends.” And
the laugh went round. And Feargus sang this
song, thinking to sober the company a little and
hoping to escape without bloodshed:—</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The song pleased the love-sick prince and
there was a round of cheers ere Feargus had
done.</p>

<p>“Thou art indeed a good minstrel,” said the
prince, “but now to the toast.”</p>

<p>“Yea, he singeth well, but he hath had over
much wine and his head is not so strong as it
once was,” said one.</p>

<p>“Nay, good sir knight, thou art mistaken,
wine hath not passed these lips to-day, for I
drink wine but sparingly; but I hold that no
man may drink this pledge an he hath a lady
whom he holdeth fairest.”</p>

<p>“Thou art mad; sit thee down,” roared the
prince, “or a halter shall sit where thy lady’s
arm should be.”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt at least put me to the proof, and
ye gentlemen all. I swear that when I ask, the
bonniest lady shall arise and walk to me across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the hall, or, an she doth not, thou mayest hang
me forthwith.”</p>

<p>Then followed roars of rude laughter, and
shouts of, “Where is she?” “Bring her forth,”
and others shouted, “’Twill be a good jest; let
the minstrel have his way.”</p>

<p>“Go on then, minstrel,” said the prince,
“since it is the wish of the company.”</p>

<p>“That will I, but thou must first give me thy
pledge that if I fail not, then wilt thou allow my
lady and myself to leave thy halls unmolested
and without scath, and will leave us to wend our
way as we may list, on two good beasts of thy
stable.”</p>

<p>“Thou art beside thyself. How could it
profit us to keep the lady of such as thou?”</p>

<p>Then the nobles, who began to feel a kind of
curiosity stirring them, said, “This is so persistent
a madman that we must needs let him
have his way.”</p>

<p>“I swear to thee, minstrel,” said the prince,
“to do as thou sayest, an thou succeed, and,
moreover, I swear to hang thee an thou failest.”</p>

<p>Feargus turned to the knights and called them
to witness, and then rose and taking his long staff
bound round with thongs, and his harp, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
walked down the hall to the door and standing
with his back against it struck a few notes on his
harp and sang this verse in strong, clear tones:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When I call she will arise</div>
<div class="verse">’Spite the fears that fill her eyes;</div>
<div class="verse">When I suffer she will weep</div>
<div class="verse">For her love is boundless deep.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Yet than I she’s nobler far,</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful as still streams are,</div>
<div class="verse">Pure as is the purest thought,</div>
<div class="verse">Or as dew the night hath brought.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Yet she is my willing slave,</div>
<div class="verse">Full of fears, she will be brave</div>
<div class="verse">When I call, and come to me,</div>
<div class="verse">For her love is as the sea.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The passionate tones of the singer had stirred
his hearers and the laugh died out on their lips
ere he had finished the first bar. Mere curiosity
had become keen interest, and there was a pause
in the buzz and murmur that had filled the hall.
He reached his right hand to his left shoulder
and from beneath the loose red plaid he wore
drew forth his great sword. This was the signal.
Torfrida arose from her place and, ere the
astonished prince could collect his senses, tripped
lightly down the hall and stood beside the aged
minstrel, the company being too much astonished
to hinder her. Siegfried started up in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
rage, and made towards them. Quickly and
with wondrous strength did Feargus draw some
ponderous benches that lay about to the front of
him as a fence, and warned the prince back.</p>

<p>“Prince, thou hast sworn, and all the company
hath witnessed; be not rash, for an thou
break promise given, thou wilt lose such worship
as is left to thee. And I ask ye, knights and
gentlemen, to see right done.”</p>

<p>Many were for Feargus, but the prince still
advanced, slowly and with great labour clearing
the benches from before him as he went. Then
Feargus set down his harp, and handed his long
staff, which was his bow, to Torfrida that she
might free it of the thongs which had served to
hide it, and he started to his full height and cast
off his grey beard and his rags and stood big and
strong in his byrny with his great sword in his
palm. Then those who had unwillingly followed
their master held back, for they knew him the
captain of the king’s guard.</p>

<p>“Thou hast stolen my lady, and I am come to
rescue her, and be he earl or boor, he that goeth
to stay me shall die.”</p>

<p>Then the prince, mad with rage, drew forth
his sword and with many oaths advanced upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
him, followed by those of his own Northumbrians
who were present. The others, Britons from
Strathclyde and Lothian and Southern Picts who
had submitted to the rule of the strangers, saw
that the minstrel was a Pict, and their jealousy
of the Northumbrians being aroused they were
less ready to see so gross a wrong done to one of
their race.</p>

<p>“Now he is a coward and recreant chief who
keeps not his pledge,” cried Feargus, “and they
be coward knights who help a lying leader.”</p>

<p>Then the Britons tried to reason with the
prince, but in vain, still he came on, followed by
his drunken rout.</p>

<p>“Back, prince, or thou shalt die,” said Feargus
once more, wishing to spare the spilling of blood.
Drunk and mad with anger, however, the prince
heeded not, but laid his steel against that of
Feargus, though it was only a moment ere the
sword of Feargus was buried in his body, and
the blood of him leaped up suddenly from his
mouth and, to the horror of his men, he fell back
dead. Then Feargus tried to stop the Northumbrians,
stout fighting men and big of body,
but they would not hearken to him, coming on
crying, “Down with him! he hath killed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
prince!” They pressed against him on the right
hand and the left, but so close the one upon the
other that they had little space to move, while
lightly Feargus swung his brand from behind
the benches, so that they could not get into him,
and legs and arms were shorn in its sweep, until
there lay before him a confused and bloody
mound, mixed up with wine cups and meat and
drink and table gear, and still the Picts and
Britons withheld from the strife. But Feargus
knew that the fight must go against him, so
thick and fast they came, wounding and trampling
on each other in their eagerness to get at
him. Then, wounded and weary of so much
sword play, in a pause of the fight he cried out
in Gaelic, “Now here am I, Feargus, son to king
Nechtan of the Hundred Fights, and kin to all ye
Picts and Britons, and my lady is of the South
Albanich by her mother’s side. Yet though of
these Northumbrians I have slain some and
maimed more, till I am sick of slaughter, yet my
lady and I must fall, so many are our enemies.
Never a friend shall he lack though all the world
be turned against him who helpeth me.”</p>

<p>Then said one to his fellows, “This must
indeed be Feargus, king Penda’s captain, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
never saw I man so giant-like or of so great
strength and hardihood. All that man can do
hath he done; shameful and unknightly of us
were it to see him, our kin, who is in his right,
destroyed.” Then many of the others agreed,
though they were loth to join the fray, fearing
for their own lands. But he who had spoken
first, one Llewellin of the Gwynedd tribe of
Britons whose lands had stretched up into the
Lothians, stepped to the leader of the Northumbrians
and for a moment the fight ceased.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “ye men of Northumbria, ye
have had your fill of fighting and it is dastardly
of all ye to attack one, though he hath ye at
some advantage. Surely your king would little
admire ye.”</p>

<p>“Hath he not slain our prince? right angry
will be the king. Not one of us dare face him
without this man’s head, stark though he be,
for he is son to king Nechtan and it must be he
who was Penda’s captain.”</p>

<p>“Then no hand will we have in this unknightly
work; but we bid ye desist, or an ye do not we
will join with Feargus, and what could we not do
under so mighty a leader?”</p>

<p>Feargus spoke out to the Lindeseymen. “Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
ye men of Lindesey, this, my lady, is Torfrida,
daughter of Sigmund, your king, and ye, men of
Mercia, I have bled for your king, and two hundred
of my men fought for him when others fled, and
all died for him at the last. If ye do not help
me we must fall.”</p>

<p>Then one Lindeseyman said: “I saw him save
prince Edwy and his thanes from the Mercians.
I will help him.”</p>

<p>“And I saw him stop the slaughter of the
Lindeseymen,” said another.</p>

<p>“And I was with him when he held the cliffs
for Penda on Trent water,” said a Mercian.</p>

<p>“And I when he saved the day for Mercia at
Camulodunum in East Anglia.”</p>

<p>“And I, and I,” said others.</p>

<p>So all these who had held aloof came down
over the barriers and stood beside him.</p>

<p>“And I and all Lindeseymen will fight for
Torfrida,” said another thane. And he cried,
“Lindesey! Lindesey!” and behind him followed
the rest of the Lindeseymen crying, “Lindesey!
Lindesey!” And the Mercian thanes cried the
cry of “Penda! Penda!” that held armies spellbound
with fear in the old days, and all the
Mercians joined them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Then said Llewellin of the Gwynedd to the
Northumbrians, “Let no more blood be spilt.
We do not want to fight ye, Northumbrians; we
would be friends.”</p>

<p>Getting scornful reply they drew their swords
and fell mightily upon the Northumbrians.
And the clang of sword on helm, and the rushing
and hurrying of mailed feet, and the cries of
“Lindesey! Lindesey!” “Penda! Penda!” filled
the hall, where late had been merriment and
a different music. And no more terrible and
savage sight fell ever on the eye of Feargus.
Torfrida had long fainted for very horror of it.
And when the din ceased there was no Northumbrian
left standing unwounded out of all that
throng.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RESCUE</span></h2>

<p>And when that fight was done the Britons and
others paused awhile, speechless, awe-stricken, at
the scene, and not without fear, for they dreaded
the wrath of the king. They spoke among
themselves, Feargus meanwhile carried Torfrida
down out of the hall to her own chamber,
and bade her make ready to depart. Then to
the British knights he said, “Much do I owe ye
for great service done, and I pledge me that if
ever ye win my land I will requite ye, as much
as gold can requite service like to this. And as
ye are many I advise ye to go in small companies,
and I will likewise, and go ye into your
own lands quickly. And if any trouble fall upon
ye now or in time to come send ye to me and I
will not be tardy in helping ye both with men
and ships.”</p>

<p>So they parted with great friendship, and
Feargus descended into the stable with Torfrida,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and chose therefrom the two best steeds and rode
forth.</p>

<p>Within the castle, the victors bade their men
to gather the wine cups and arms and horses
from the stable, and every beast was laden with
the spoil. And it fell that as they rode through
the wood northward, making great haste to get
out of king Sigeberht’s land, Feargus said,
“Behold, how the castle of prince Siegfried
burneth,” and Torfrida turned and saw that all
the lift was lit up at the back of them and filled
with sparks of burning timber without number.
A moment they gazed awe-stricken at the
glorious sight. And they met many people on
their road, but these being mostly British stood
not in their way. After they had gone many
miles they made the coast and found one ready
to ferry them over Forth, and so they got aboard
with their two beasts and sailed up beyond the
Ochils and there landed, and once more made
their way northward. At length they drew nigh
to the city where dwelt the king of the South
Picts and were for going straight forward hoping
to pass by unseen of the people. Hardly had
they got within sight of the town, however,
before they saw a party of horse and foot, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
footmen being so fleet that they kept pace
with the horses. They quickly came round
Feargus, but he warned them to lay no hand
on either his lady or himself, but the captain
laughed and rode at him crying, “Render thyself
up, for thou art our prisoner and must come
before the king.”</p>

<p>“I will come before the king, sir captain, but
I warn thee that no man’s hand will I allow on
my bridle.”</p>

<p>The captain laughed again, and stretched
forth his hand, whereupon Feargus struck him
with his sheathed sword that he fell senseless.
Then quickly turning their horses’ heads they
wheeled suddenly, leaving the soldiers behind
them, and dashed across towards the gate of the
city. There they entered and rode up to the
king’s hall and were surrounded by his people,
and the party which had been sent to bring
them in now coming, took them to the king, who
ordered that they should be cast into prison, for
Feargus did not tell them that he was king
Nechtan’s son, thinking they might deem him so
rich a prize that they would not readily release
him. Then was Feargus much downcast, for
his spirits had been high at thought that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
were near his own land after so many wanderings.</p>

<p>Now it fell that there was one Domlech, a man
of the North Picts, staying in the town at that
time; he had come as a messenger from king
Nechtan, and he beheld Feargus when he entered
with Torfrida. By his speech, which differed
slightly from that of the Southern Picts, he knew
him to be a countryman of his, and by the richness
of his byrny he judged him to be a chief.
Domlech, however, said nothing, deeming it
best to keep his own counsel till he won home to
king Nechtan. And when the old king heard
that one who was seemingly a great chief of his
people had been taken by the king of the South
Picts, he was angry, and sent a captain who was
well known throughout the land as a mighty
warrior to demand the stranger and with him
went a strong force. So Feargus and Torfrida
had been prisoners but a week when one night
the peal of the pipes burst upon the ear of
Feargus and he knew it was the slogan of the
king of Albainn. Here were his noble father
Nechtan and his friends, and the end of his
wanderings had come at last! An hour passed
and he began to grow weary of waiting, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the door opened and his jailor came in and bade
him follow him, for his kinsmen of North Alban
had come to demand him. So he was led up
out of the dungeon to the light where he found
Torfrida, and they saw that the Picts were all
around the walls, having stolen up to the town
silently, making no sound until they were at the
very gates, when they demanded their kinsman,
whoever he might be, who was held prisoner.
Then the king of the South Picts agreed to
release him if they would withdraw. And so
they opened the gate, and they two rode out
towards the captain who commanded the host of
Nechtan. And Feargus could speak to no man
so was he overcome at this so happy end to their
troubles, and then at last they came into the
captain’s tent, and behold the captain was
Duncan! And each had deemed the other dead,
and like men bereft of their senses they gazed
upon each other and fell to greeting for very
gladness. By reason of their great strength it
had chanced that Duncan and Alastair and some
others of Feargus’s company had been healed of
their wounds at Winwid, and had found their
way back to their king. So there was great
rejoicing in the camp that night, and the townspeople<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
wondered why they moved not away but
made so merry. In the morning they marched
northward, and when they won the halls of
Nechtan, Feargus entered alone, but it was with
difficulty he passed the men who guarded the
king, for none knew him. At length he called
for Duncan to order that he should be let see the
king and so won in, and came to the king’s own
chamber, and many stood about and looked at
him and he at them, but they minded him not.
Not so the king, for though he had thought him
dead, and though he came now in strange arms,
yet no sooner did he enter than the old man
knew him and started back a moment and then
clasped him to him and wept. And when the
chiefs knew that the stranger was Feargus they
made great rejoicing and drew him and Torfrida
round their city in a chariot. And Torfrida was
brought in, and the king was mightily pleased
with her, and took great pride in his son, for he
knew that between all those seas there was not
a warrior like to him. And in the land, also,
was great rejoicing, the fathers were as glad as
though they had each found a son that was lost,
and the sons as though they had found one of their
brethren. For king Nechtan of the hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
battles was greatly regarded, being one who
never broke faith or failed an Albannach in need,
and it was thus that in this present, he having
sent to succour whom he thought a stranger had
won a son instead. As to Torfrida, she was so
overcome with joy at this happy end of their
troubles that she kept her bed for a week and
then arose to make ready for the marriage feast.
Not a month had passed since they won home to
Alban before a ship came thereto, and brought
a messenger from Edwy, who told how Osbert
had turned upon king Sigmund and slain him,
and seized the kingdom and joined it to his own.
After vainly trying to rouse his father’s men to
make war upon Osbert with him, their lawful
king, Edwy had been forced to fly with a handful
of faithful followers, and, reaching the fens
before Osbert knew which way he had taken,
sent his messenger in a small ship to Alban, asking
the aid of the king of the Picts for the sake of
Feargus, whom he had long thought dead, else he
knew that he would have returned ere now to
succour him.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIGHT IN FENLAND</span></h2>

<p>Then did Feargus mind him of his promise to
return to save his friend Edwy. So king Nechtan
called a council and sent to his shipmen to make
ready, and gathered together a host and set
Feargus in command with Duncan and Alastair
and others who had been in Mercia with Penda.
And right gladly they armed them to serve once
more their mighty captain; and on the morrow
reached the ships and sailed for the land of
Lindesey. So with good winds they soon made
the coast and anchored fast their ships in the
river Witham and sailed in smaller boats into
the fen country; and when they had gotten well
within it they landed, and made for the woods
and there found Edwy at the trysting place.
Right full of gladness were he and his men to see
the Albanich, and when he beheld Feargus at
their head he was like to one beside himself for
gladness. Then said he to his men, “Now of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
surety shall my father be avenged and our
country saved from the spoiler, for here is the
greatest captain in all this land to lead us, with
such a company of giants as was never seen, and
every man a brother to his fellow, so that little
wonder it is that they have always the victory.”</p>

<p>Then said Feargus, “Now, good Edwy, we
will to the war if thou wilt lead us through these
marshes.”</p>

<p>“We will have less journey to travel than
methought at the first, for Osbert hath found
that I have betaken me to the fens and for many
days past we have been hunted like wolves, by
men and dogs.”</p>

<p>“Then what is thy wish?”</p>

<p>“The army of Osbert lieth only some twenty
miles northward of us. My rede is that we
march by night, keeping the woods by day, until
we come up with them, and fall upon them
privily in the dark, for by such means will we
save our men and much bloodshed.”</p>

<p>“Thy counsel is good; what dost think,
Duncan, and thou, Alastair?”</p>

<p>“Better rede we cannot offer.”</p>

<p>“Then so it shall be,” said Feargus, “and how
far doth their host lie from the river?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“Twenty miles from Witham by the water.”</p>

<p>“And dost know the ground?”</p>

<p>“None should know it better.”</p>

<p>“Then thou canst place us all around his
camp, that we may attack together?”</p>

<p>“That can I, if thy men can keep silence.”</p>

<p>“As silent as the stars they can be, or as the
fish that swim in the sea. Let us row up to the
point where Witham joins the Bane Water, and
there leave the boats in among the reeds.”</p>

<p>That same night they hied them back to the
boats and rowed up among all that fen water,
and no man spoke, and no sound broke the night
save the cry of the peaseweeps and the whaups
which anon flew across the boats’ track as they
rowed. And the osiers swayed in the night
wind and the long train of boats full of giant
forms glided up the grey water. At length they
landed and marched northward along the bank
of the river Bane which flows into Witham. At
daybreak they halted and lay in a small wood
hard by until nightfall, then on. And when they
drew nigh to where the host of Osbert lay,
Feargus bid Duncan cross the stream to the
west side and there strike through the wood a
piece, when they were to turn them east till they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
saw the camp of the enemy. Edwy he sent
also on along the other bank to return upon
Osbert when he had won north of his army, while
Alastair was to close in likewise from the east
shielded by the osiers. And Feargus himself
held the south with the road to their boats. And
so each force was to wait till its captain heard
the signal from the other three, which he was to
answer with a wolf’s cry, at which they were to
close in and attack, Edwy first with his Lindeseymen.</p>

<p>In Osbert’s camp all was feasting and merriment
that night, but at last the whole host lay
sleeping, and even the watchers around the camp
dozed; till one, a half-drunk soldier, who
paced the river side, heard the cry of the howlet
from the wood which lay to the west of them,
then answering cries from the northward and
east, and the man wondered that so many owls
should be about, and kicked the bits of wood
into the stream with half-tipsy thoughtfulness.
Twice the cry came again from the east, then
Feargus from the south gave the answering cry—their
first round of signals. Then each captain
led his men in towards the camp and drew
so near that, all being sunk in sleep, they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
hear the tread of the watchers. Still the soldier
paced the water side, until of a sudden, close to
him on the west, he heard the cry of the wolf,
then from the north and east the same weird
sound arose; then came a pause, and Feargus,
peering through the bulrushes in the river,
singled out the camp of Osbert himself. At
that moment the sentry was wondering whether
to call the night guard seeing there were so many
wolves abroad, but he fixed an arrow in his bow
and waited, stirring the fire to brighter blaze to
scare the wild creatures. Then from the south
Feargus uttered the cry which was the final
signal and all in a moment came the sound of
the rush of Edwy and his Lindeseymen through
the long sweet meadow grass to the north of
them and the death cry of a wounded Anglian
arose into the night. In a moment the camp
of Osbert was awake and men were running
wildly hither and thither, tumbling over one
another in their hurry to get their arms, and the
captains shouted to the men and the men knew
not what had happened. Then midst all the
confusion came showers of arrows from the
osier planting to the east, showers from the
wood that skirted them to the west, and showers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
from the bulrushes which lined the river bed.
When they turned east the osiers started to life
and dark and silent forms dashed forth to fall
upon them like a frost wind upon the fields.
Then the host of Osbert, half armed and half
mad with fear, turned west, when the willow
wood on that side of them rendered up its armed
host, and Duncan and his Picts came upon
them claymore in hand. Osbert’s captains
shouted once more for order and urged their men
to stand fast and set out the bowmen, and Osbert
himself marshalled them and encouraged those
that wrought with spears here, there the swordsmen.
But to the Anglians and Lindeseymen,
used as they were to the noise and rush of battle,
the war cry and the clash of arms, there was
something fearsome in the silence of their foes,
and in their unusual size and garb. Osbert,
finding enemies on three sides of him now turned
his men with their backs to the river to protect
their flank, when lo! a shower of arrows flew
among them from the flank and the Anglians
who stood in the rear ranks fell in droves, and
as the terrible sense of being trapped by a silent
and unknown foe, of seemingly overwhelming
numbers, crept over the terrified and demoralised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
footmen, they heard the splash of water and the
southward wing of the Picts under Feargus left
their lair among the bulrushes, and dashed
through the water breast deep. In an instant
the river bank was alive with men of giant shape,
who burst upon them, their long plaids floating
in the wind behind, and for the first time the
night was startled by the voices of their foemen
as they raised the old shout of “Albanich!
Albanich!” and from east and west came answering
cries “Albanich! Albanich!” from the
followers of Duncan and Alastair; while from
the north rose the shout of “Lindesey!
Lindesey! God save King Edwy!” Then Osbert
knew that his old enemy had returned
and that Edwy the hunted had turned hunter
and had trapped the game, and he trembled.
And there arose a din as though Babel were
loosened. Again Osbert ordered his men to
stand fast, but ordering was useless now, and
after an hour’s desperate fighting, utterly beaten,
the whole host turned and fled over the dark fen.
Then, seeing the Picts start in pursuit, Edwy
called aloud to those near him, “Pardon to all!
Let the others go, but spare not the murderer,”
and so he ran towards where he believed Osbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to be, and it was then about the dawn so that
he could well distinguish faces. Soon there
started one up before him and struck the weapon
suddenly from his hand, saying, “Ha! king of
Lindesey, I have sought thee long; my time and
thy time have come together,” and so he rushed
upon him, fury in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Nay, not so fast—thou canst war well on
old men and boys; thou art able to fight bigger
folk, and here is one for thee,” said Duncan,
“thou and I have long been debtors each to
other.”</p>

<p>Osbert waited no more, but turned suddenly
upon him with all his force, but he had one to
deal with stronger and more skilled than himself
and he fell back, stabbed through the heart.
So died the arch traitor who had given great
trouble to many, whereof this history treats.
Then Feargus and Duncan and Alastair brought
in their men, and Feargus calling the Lindeseymen
and all the captains around him, took the
circlet of gold from the helm of Osbert and
placed it on the brow of Edwy. Then all the
warriors raised a great shout and cried, “God
save king Edwy!” And so they fell to the
booty, which they found in the camp of Osbert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and made themselves a great feast. And after
they had rested and feasted them, they marched
across towards Lindum, taking with them the
head of Osbert. When they reached the city
set on the hill, the people came forth to meet
them, and all men swore to follow the king.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE HISTORY COMETH TO AN END</span></h2>

<p>And so Feargus and his Picts helped Edwy to
clear the land of Lindesey and they sent word
out to all the thanes around that Edwy was king
of the lands of his fathers, and if any would not
call him king there would be war with him and
all the Picts with him upon his side. And so
after awhile Feargus returned, leaving Alastair
to be king Edwy’s captain until all the land was
brought under him. And they won Alban, and
on the third day of their return was a great
feast spread, and all the chiefs of that country
were guests and many kings and princes, with
Llewellin of Gwynedd and one MacGilliosa, a
stout stranger from Galloway, and many Picts
and Britons from Lothian, who had helped
Feargus in times past, as this history showeth,
for the beautiful and noble Torfrida, whose fame
was in men’s mouths as a heroine for all time,
was wed to Feargus of Albainn, son to king
Nechtan of the Hundred Battles.</p>

<h2 id="ENGLAND_IN_PENDAS_DAY">ENGLAND IN PENDA’S DAY</h2>

<p>Of the Britain of which the foregoing story treats
we know but little, and the strong Anglo-Saxon
bias of many otherwise excellent writers has
obscured what few facts we really possess of the
stormy times of the great and faithful patriot
king Penda. It may be the case that the Saxons
had a reputation for cruelty, as the late Mr.
Freeman points out, but we can have no true
picture of the England of those times if we imagine
that our English or Saxon ancestors were ever
numerous or barbarous enough to exterminate,
as historians would have us believe they did, the
native Welsh or British, except in rare instances.
The foregoing story makes it clear that the “English,”
though a strong and well-organised handful
of soldiers, were but a large handful after all, just
as the Roman settlers, and Normans of later
times, were but a handful compared to the whole
population. Historians have based their beliefs
in the Teutonic origin of the “English” people
of to-day largely on language, on the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the surnames of the majority of the people are
English and that the language they speak to-day
is chiefly of English origin. We know now that
a language is not necessarily an index to the race
of the people, but that it is often acquired by contact
with another race who spoke it and who may
or may not have been its original owners.</p>

<p>The story shows that the country was at that
time covered with vast woods and forests, with
fens and marshes to the east, and with wide
stretches of mountain and waste on the north-west.
In all these tracts, as well as in the
strong cities of Roman-British origin, the natives
were able to hold their own, or to make terms
with their Anglo-Saxon conquerors. It was only
very slowly that those who served the conquerors
as slaves or villeins adopted English names, as
documentary evidence shows, even in the east
of England, which has been assumed rather
rashly to be the most Teutonic part of the island.
The bands of outlaws, who were so noted even as
late as the time of Edward III. in the Forest of
Arden in Warwickshire, in Charnwood Forest, in
Waltham Forest, and in the Fens of Bedford,
Lincoln, and the East generally, were probably
British refugees or their descendants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of Feargus it is hoped will help the
reader to understand the close kinship of both
English and Scots with the “Welsh.” It is certainly
time that we realised the fact that those
Britons whom “Anglo-Saxon” writers have
despised were really at that time a civilised and
Christian race who had moreover been in contact
with the highest culture the world possessed for
a period of no less than five hundred years. We
must ultimately realise that it is to them and to
the admixture of Roman blood amongst them,
rather than to the savage fighting men by whom
they were conquered, or to the still more ruthless
Norsemen who came later, that we owe the great
beginnings of the civilisation of which we make
so much to-day.</p>

<p>England in Penda’s time was broken up into at
least twenty small kingdoms which were more or
less independent; he made Mercia a great power
by his statesman-like alliances with the smaller
kingdoms and with the natives, both British and
Picts, Christian and heathen. These states included
the North English of the Osbert of our
story; the Middle English, the South English, the
Hwiccas, and the Gainas and Lindeseymen of Sigmund,
whose names still survive in Gainsborough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and in the district of Lindsey in Lincolnshire.
To the east were the East Anglians, to the south
the kingdom of Wessex. To the west of Mercia
dwelt the tribes of South Wales, while the territory
of the great Christian race of the Gwynedd
included North Wales and stretched up into
the region of Strathclyde, which, roughly speaking,
was composed of Westmorland, Cumberland,
and the central and, excepting Galloway, the
western part of Southern Scotland as far as the
river Forth and the great Romano-British
city of Camelon on the Roman wall near
Falkirk.</p>

<p>The northern Cymry or Gwynedd had, however,
been separated from their kinsmen to the
south owing to the important capture of Chester
and the Wirral Peninsula by Ethelfrith, king of
Northumbria in 607. It is to them we owe one
of the most beautiful and refined cycles of folk
tales in Europe—the legends of Arthur and the
far earlier mythological stories translated by Lady
Charlotte Guest in the <cite>Mabinogion</cite>, of which
they were a development and somewhat of a
medley. In every respect, save possession of the
ruthlessness and strength which characterise
savage races, the Gwynedd were in advance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
their conquerors whose very heathenism was of a
comparatively low type.</p>

<p>When Penda began his reign the dominant
power was Northumbria, but the overthrow of its
great king Edwin by Penda and Cadwalla, king
of the Gwynedd, brought Mercia to the first place.</p>

<p>The list of Penda’s subsequent victories is a
long one and more brilliant than that of any
general of his times, not excepting the Welsh hero
Cadwalla. On his overthrow after thirty years
of victory Mercia for a few months passed under
the rule of Northumbria, but was restored to
Penda’s son Wulfere by the act of the Mercians
themselves. His older son, Peada, had married
Oswy’s daughter and already adopted Christianity.
Under him and his brother Wulfere Mercia became
Christian, though this probably only meant that
the king and court were “converted” and the
people were expected to follow. The men who
were really in earnest in the spread either of
Christianity or Heathenism, like Edwin, Penda,
Oswald, Oswy, and Peada, were few. They, and
Penda, the great ruler and organiser, stood out
from among their fellows as giants amongst
pigmies and gave their mental and moral backbone
to the English people. So solid indeed were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the foundations which Penda had laid in Mercia
that for nearly two centuries after she maintained
her place as practically the first power in Britain.</p>

<p>Penda “the Strenuous,” being a heathen, has
received scant justice at the hands of Christian
writers, but even they have reluctantly admitted
his possession of that chief mark of civilisation—tolerance.
His character has also puzzled modern
historians, but puzzled them needlessly I think,
for the few facts we have give the key to the position.
It is clear that the advanced and Christian
British would not have joined hands with him had
he shown any inclination to force his heathenism
upon them. In the same way had he intended
to conquer them, which was the averred purpose
of Christian Northumbria, they would not have
chosen him their political ally, nor would the
small midland states around him. What then
seems to have attracted them alike was his unaggressive
spirit towards the unaggressive—the
British and the small states—and the tremendous
antagonism he showed to any attempt at aggression
on the part of the larger kingdoms—Northumbria,
East Anglia, and Wessex. Though the
small kingdoms are massed together by historians
under the general title of “Mercia” they appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
under Penda’s guidance to have really retained
their integrity and their kings and ealdormen and
to have formed a defensive federation rather than
a single state. This may have been the secret of
Penda’s power and of Mercia’s greatness.</p>

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
